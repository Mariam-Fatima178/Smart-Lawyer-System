Bilal Moeen Butt alias Bilal Hussain Butt v. The State etc,4.32,Criminal Law,Lahore High Court,"Through this petition, petitioner seeks post arrest bail in case FIR registered for 
offence under Section 489-F PPC","i) What would be status of case at post-arrest bail stage if dishonest intention of 
an accused involved in issuing subject cheque requires further determination?
ii) If accused makes out his case as one of further inquiry, whether his previous 
criminal record without any conviction may be based to disentitle him to the grant 
of post arrest bail?
","i) A regular and smooth business relationship of the parties existed as well as the 
accused had been paying the due amounts to the complainant in near past.
Dishonest intention of the accused involved in issuing of subject cheque is the 
question requiring determination by the learned trial court after recording of 
evidence.
ii) Seven other cases were alleged having previously been registered against the 
accused but he has not been convicted in any one of those. Accused makes out his 
case as one of further inquiry.
","i) If dishonest intention of the accused involved in issuing subject cheque requires 
further determination, then case would be one of further inquiry into his guilt.
ii) If accused makes out his case one of further inquiry, then his previous criminal

post arrest bail.",Mr. Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi
Muhammad Hamza v. The State etc,5.11,Criminal Law,Lahore High Court,"Through this petition, the petitioner has sought post arrest bail in case FIR 
registered for offence u/s 366 of PPC","What would be fate of case at post-arrest bail stage if the culpability of the 
petitioner for an offence punishable under Section 336 PPC requires further 
determination by the trial court?","Section 336 PPC manifests that intention to cause hurt or knowledge that the 
alleged act is likely to cause hurt is a necessary requirement to constitute offence 
under Section 336 PPC. But when occurrence prima facie seems accidental in 
nature, then section 336 PPC would not be applicable.

",4.33,Family Law,Lahore High Court,"Through this petition, judgment and decree passed by respondent No.1 has been 
assailed, by virtue of which a suit for recovery of maintenance allowance and 
dower filed by respondent No.2 against the petitioner has been decreed to the 
extent of maintenance allowance.","Where a Nikah between the spouses has been performed, however, the marriage is 
not consummated as the Rukhsati has not taken place, in such an eventuality, 
whether a wife is entitled to maintenance allowance?","Section 9 of the Ordinance spells out that where a husband fails to maintain his 
wife, she in addition to seeking other legal remedies (as contemplated in West 
Pakistan Family Courts Act 1964) can also seek maintenance allowance. It shall 
not be out of place to mention here that no condition of Rukhasti or 
consummation of marriage has been mentioned therein. (…) claim of 
maintenance by the wife is not conditional with the rukhsati or consummation of 
marriage. It has also been elaborated that in such circumstances the conduct of the 
spouses will be of utmost importance while granting a claim of maintenance. (…) 
A wife who is willing to, but cannot, discharge her marital obligations for no fault 
of her own, rather is prevented to do so by any act or omission of her husband is 
legally entitled to receive her due maintenance from her husband, and the latter 
cannot benefit from his own wrong.”","Claim of maintenance by the wife is not conditional with the rukhsati or

Millat Tractors Limited v. Federal Board of Revenue & others,4.44,Tax Law,Lahore High Court,"This is an appeal under Section 3 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 and brings 
a challenge to the order by a learned Single Judge. The relief claimed in the 
constitutional petition was for seeking a declaration regarding SRO to be struck 
down as having been issued without lawful authority. Further reliefs were claimed 
on the basis of the former SRO under which the appellant claimed the benefit of 
refund of sales tax from the respondents","i) Whether Federal Board of Revenue has the power to take away vested rights 
and to upset past transactions?
ii) Whether Section 50 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 does confer power upon FBR 
to make retrospective application of an amendment made in the Sales Tax Rules, 
2006?
iii) How eligible person can be defined under Refund Claims of Recognized 
Agricultural Tractor Manufacturers Rules, 2012?
iv) Whether an enactment which prejudicially affects vested rights or the legality 
of past transactions can be given retrospective operation?
v) Whether any earlier notification contained a representation which was acted 
upon, its effect could have been nullified by an executive act?
","i) FBR neither has the power to take away vested rights and to upset past transactions nor to apply a notification retrospectively under the purported powers conferred by section 50 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990. ii) Section 50 does not confer power upon FBR to make retrospective application of an amendment made in the Sales Tax Rules, 2006. iii) A reference to definition of the term “eligible person” would also be apt under the circumstances. According to the definition an eligible person mean a manufacturer of agricultural tractors who supplies tractors to a person holding a valid proof of land holding such as agricultural pass book and copy of record of rights of agricultural land. iv) In our jurisprudence the rule is now settled and vouched by respectable authority that an enactment which prejudicially affects vested rights or the legality of past transactions cannot be given retrospective operation. This rule is based on the principle of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation. v) The question came up for discussion in M/s Army Welfare Sugar Mills Ltd. and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PTCL 1993 CL 188) and the Supreme Court of Pakistan once again delved into the doctrine of promissory estoppel and went on to hold that a representation through a statutory regulatory order (SRO) could only be withdrawn by a legislative act. In M/s Army Welfare Sugar Mills too the benefit granted by a notification was sought to be withdrawn by a subsequent notification and it was concluded that the earlier notification contained a representation which could have been rescinded before it was acted upon or if it was acted upon, its effect could have been nullified by statutory provision and not by an executive act. This means that vested rights could not be impaired either by an executive act or by the exercise of powers delegated by the legislature unless the legislature has specifically granted delegation to enact retrospective measures… In the guise of making rules, vested and concluded rights could not have been taken away by the enactment of a notification which was to take effect retrospectively. This could only have been done by the legislature under its primary power to legislate.","i) Federal Board of Revenue neither has the power to take away vested rights and 
to upset past transactions nor to apply a notification retrospectively.
ii) Section 50 does not confer power upon FBR to make retrospective application 
of an amendment made in the Sales Tax Rules, 2006.

been challenged in this and connected W.P. by the landowners. Both petitions are 
being decided by this common judgment.","i) Whether any area of forest which qualifies to be treated as forest can be put to 
any other use when the department has remained fail to declare such area either as 
a protected forest or reserve forest?
ii) Whether the department without any reasonable cause can justify the 
acquisition and setting up of the project on an area which comprises of 
agricultural and forest land?","i) According to the reports filed by the departments, when the area has not been declared either as a protected forest or reserve forest under the provisions of the Forest Act, 1927, this does not make any difference since the area qualifies to be treated as such and notifications ought to have been issued in this regard by the Forest Department. This failure to do so will not detract from the fact that the area under acquisition is a reserve forest and cannot be put to any other use unless the provisions of section 27 of the Act, 1927 are scrupulously followed. ii) The department without any reasonable cause cannot justify the setting up of the project on an area which comprises of agricultural and forest land and to change the nature of forest land and carry out construction for setting up of a  Divisional Headquarter. It is also unjustified to cut trees which are standing on the forest area and to change the status of land used for flood mitigation in any manner. The act of the respondents contravenes the holding of High Court in Public Interest Law Association of Pakistan as well as of Shah Zaman Khan by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

passed by learned Civil Judge whereby the suit for specific performance and 
injunction, instituted by the appellant, has been dismissed. The appeal is 
accompanied by an application seeking to exclude the period for pursuing the 
remedy before forum without jurisdiction i.e. the learned District Court.","i) What is status of plaint returned under order VII Rule 10 of CPC for

iii) How the litigant, who seeks the exclusion of time period for pursuing remedy 
in forum without jurisdiction, ought to plead relevant facts and who has initial 
burden to prove the same?
iv) Whether wrong advice of a counsel can be permitted as grounds for excluding 
period consumed in pursuing remedy in wrong forum?
v) Whether availing of remedy within time provided by law is merely a 
technicality?","i) There is no cavil to the settled proposition of law that where the plaint is returned under Order VII, Rule 10 of the Code for its representation before the Court of competent jurisdiction, for all intent and purposes, it is treated as a fresh institution. ii) It is equally an established principle that although section 14 of the Limitation Act has no direct application to the appeals but the principles enumerated therein  can be taken into the consideration by the Court while ascertaining the availability of ‘sufficient cause’ for condonation of delay under section 5 of the Limitation Act. iii) It is incumbent upon the litigant, seeking exclusion of time period for pursuing remedy in forum without jurisdiction, to plead the facts to justify the grant of relief and by reasonably demonstrating due diligence and good faith in pursuing the matter before the learned Court having no jurisdiction to adjudicate. The initial burden, to show the above elements for seeking to exclude the period consumed in prosecuting case before learned forum without jurisdiction, is on the applicant pleading such relief. iv) In “Abdul Ghani” case the court has observed that in circumstances where error of pursuing remedy before forum is fairly obvious and it could have been avoided by exercising even little diligence or adopting some care, even the wrong advice of a counsel cannot be foundation for enlargement of time consumed in pursuing remedy before wrong forum… v) Availing of remedy within the period provided by law is not merely a technicality.

the respondents, by moving an application under Order VII Rule 11 “CPC” on the 
ground that suit is barred by law and is not maintainable. The application was
accepted. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioners preferred an appeal but of no avail

protection of his rights without seeking partition?
ii) Whether there is any exception to the general rule that a co-sharer can institute 
a suit for permanent injunctions against a co-sharer?","i) Law is consistent to this effect that every co-sharer/co-owner is owner in each and every inch of the joint property until it is partitioned by metes and bounds. It is also an oft repeated principle of law that a co-sharer/co-owner cannot change the nature of the joint property or raise construction without consent of the other co-sharers/co-owners. If a co-sharer is dispossessed from the joint property in his/her possession by any other co-sharer, the remedy lies for regaining his/her possession either in a suit under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 or by way of a suit for partition. ii) The matter, however, would become different in a case when a co-sharer intends to change the nature of the joint holding or threatens the other co-sharers to divest from their right in the joint property as co-owner. In such a case, such co-owner can institute a suit for injunction restraining the former from changing the nature of the joint land or raising any construction upon the same. In the said eventuality, it is for the former to first of all get the joint land partitioned","i) A co-sharer/co-owner cannot institute a suit for injunction for the protection of

the State Bank of Pakistan has no jurisdiction to hear and decide service matters

iii) Whether any of the litigating parties could be allowed to re-agitate the matter

they shall approach the superior owners (aala maalikan) and offer them share of

ii) Mere the cultivation is not a sole criterion / reason to confer proprietary rights

Humaira Mehboob v. Summit Bank Limited etc ,5.67,Civil Law,Lahore High Court,"This appeal in terms of Section 22 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of 
Finances) Ordinance, 2001 arising out of execution proceedings calls in question 
the vires of order whereby learned Judge Banking Court proceeded to dismiss the 
application filed by the Appellant. She also challenges order regarding fixation of 
reserve price of the mortgaged property","i) Whether a judgment debtor is estopped from its own conduct to file objection 
belatedly when he/she did not file objection on the report of evaluator regarding 
valuation of the property at the time of filing report?
ii) Whether the Banking Court is to fix reserve price of the mortgaged property on 
the report of evaluator appointed by the court or on the report of an evaluator
privately hired by the judgment debtor? 
iii) Whether anything stops a judgment debtor to locate and bring forward a buyer 
of his choice either in the auction or before the Court prior to the sale if the 
property is being sold for a price which in the estimation of the judgment debtor is 
on the lower side?","i) The record does not show that at the time of filing this report, the Appellant has ever filed an objection while the “Banking Court” in order dated 13.03.2023 observed that “an opportunity was given to the judgment debtor for submission of objection on the valuation report but the judgment debtor has not filed the objection at that time and reserve price was fixed on 09.02.2023. The judgment debtor filed the objection petition at belated stage just to linger on execution proceedings”. Admittedly, execution proceedings are underway since year 2014 and the Appellant was well aware about it but she knowingly did not file objections at the relevant time rather the same were filed belatedly on 18.03.2023 as is evident from the order sheet attached with record so she is estopped from her own conduct. ii) Pertinently, fixing the value of the property is a matter of opinion, and the Court cannot give its opinion on such a point. It appears that the object of the above proviso is to relieve the Court from the burden of affirming the accuracy of the value of the property shown in the proclamation of sale and to enable the prospective purchaser to form his own opinion relying upon the estimates given by the parties. After all, Order XXI Rule 66 (2) (e) CPC stipulates that the proclamation shall contain every other thing which the Court considers material for a purchaser to know in order to judge the nature and value of the property. Notwithstanding the afore-mentioned provision, with the availability and benefit of the evaluation reports from the PBA approved evaluators, the Courts do fix the reserve price of the properties being put to auction on the basis of the value placed therein. In the case in hand, the Appellant, while relying upon her evaluation report, has invited this Court to disregard the report prepared by the “Evaluator”. The contention so raised cannot be accepted. The fact that the evaluation report prepared under the instructions of the Appellant places higher price of the mortgaged property than the evaluation report, which the “Evaluator” prepared under the directions of the “Banking Court”, should not form basis for rejecting the latter report. The preference would always be given to evaluation report prepared under the orders of the Courts rather than a report which is prepared at the behest of a judgment debtor. In this case, the reserve price was fixed by the “Banking Court” based on the report of “Evaluator” hence it ensures reasonableness, fairness and otherwise promotes transparency whereas mere bald assertion of inadequacy of reserve price fixed by a private evaluator not appointed by the Court is per se no ground to re-fix the reserve price especially when no substantial injury was otherwise caused. It is not uncommon for the judgment debtors to prepare the evaluation report showing exaggerated value of the mortgaged properties in order to delay and frustrate the auction process. It may again be emphasized that evaluation report by the “Evaluator” was prepared under the orders of the “Banking Court” and, therefore, the selection is not between the evaluation reports of the contesting purchasers that the Court is merely accepting the value placed by one side as ipse dixit. iii) Nothing stops a judgment debtor to locate and bring forward a buyer of his choice either in the auction or before the Court prior to the sale if the property is being sold for a price which in the estimation of the judgment debtor is on the lower side. For this very purpose Rule 83 Order 21 CPC has been enacted under which Court sales can be postponed to enable a judgment debtor for raising money through private sale of the property","i) A judgment debtor is estopped from its own conduct to file objection belatedly 
when he/she did not file objection on the report of evaluator regarding valuation 
of the property at the time of filing report.
ii) The Banking Court is to fix reserve price of the mortgaged property on the 
report of evaluator appointed by the court and not on the report of an evaluator
privately hired by the judgment debtor. 
iii) Nothing stops a judgment debtor to locate and bring forward a buyer of his 
choice either in the auction or before the Court prior to the sale if the property is 
being sold for a price which in the estimation of the judgment debtor is on the

withdrawal of prosecution of Case FIR in respect of offences u/s
353,186,427,336,148 & 149 PPC, 16 MPO and Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 
1997 was turned down.
","Whether u/s 10(3) (e)(iii) & (f) of the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service Act, 
2006 and Section 494 Cr.P.C., a public prosecutor is vested with an authority to 
withdraw prosecution of any person either generally or in respect of any one or 
more offences?","From the bare reading of the Section 10(3) (e)(iii) & (f) of the Punjab Criminal 
Prosecution Service Act, 2006 and Section 494 Cr.P.C., it is manifestly clear that, 
a public prosecutor is vested with an authority to withdraw prosecution of any 
person either generally or in respect of any one or more offences but the same is 
subject to the “consent” of the Court. The consent of the Court implies its judicial 
discretion, which undoubtedly can be exercised by applying its judicial mind. 
While exercising its discretion, it is the bounden duty of the court to ensure that 
normal course of justice is not deflected for unseen reasons and there should be no 
indication of throttling the prosecution. Objective criteria relatable to public 
policy or public peace and administration of justice is squarely missing in the 
instant case. The ground that 9/10 co-accused have already been acquitted by the 
trial court is directly related to the detailed appreciation of the evidence, which 
cannot be undertaken for the purpose of deciding whether “consent” to the 
withdrawal of application should be accorded or not. No doubt, the legislature has 
empowered the Public Prosecutor to withdraw prosecution of any person either 
generally or in respect of any one or more offences prior to the pronouncement of 
judgment but at the same time a clog has been placed that the same shall be 
subject to the “consent of the Court”. In this way a sacred duty has been bestowed 
upon the court to see that the permission is not sought for on the grounds 
extraneous to the interest of justice and the offences which are against the State go 
unpunished merely for the reasons that the Government has decided not to 
prosecute such offenders under the law. If the accused is of the view that his case 
is at par to that 9/10 acquitted co-accused then the same could better be adjudged 
during judicial process of trial and not in isolation and secrecy of government 
department.","From the bare reading of the Section 10(3) (e)(iii) & (f) of the Punjab Criminal 
Prosecution Service Act, 2006 and Section 494 Cr.P.C., it is manifestly clear that,

Pir Muhammad Khan (deceased) through Legal Heirs and others (PLD 1985 Supreme Court 341). When the position is no such separate clause has been mentioned in the purported general power of attorney, the said power of attorney cannot be utilized for effecting a gift by the attorney without intentions and directions of the principal to gift the property, which intentions and directions must be proved on record. Reliance in this regard is placed on Mst Naila Kausar and another v.

In this regard reliance is placed on Hafiz Tassaduq Hussain Vs. Muhammad Din through Legal Heirs and others (PLD 2011 Supreme Court 241), Sajjad Ahmad Khan v.

The State v. Asjad Mehmood.,6.11,Criminal law,Lahore High Court,"The appellant has assailed his conviction and sentence recorded by the learned 
Addl. Sessions Judge, in a State case F.I.R , an offence under Section 302 PPC,

direction to pay Rs.3,00,000/- as compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased 
under Section 544-A of Cr.P.C, which would be recoverable as arrears of land 
revenue and in case of default in payment thereof, he would further undergo 06-
months S.I. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the learned trial court, the 
appellant has assailed his conviction and sentence by filing an appeal. The learned 
trial court also referred Murder Reference to confirm the death sentence awarded 
to the appellant, as both the matters arising from the same judgment of the learned 
trial court are being disposed of through this consolidated judgment.","i) Whether conviction can be based on absconsion alone especially when ocular 
evidence has been disbelieved?
ii) Whether delay in lodging the FIR , is fatal to the prosecution’s case? 
iii) What would be the effect if the prosecution withholds its material witness?","i) The appellant was indeed absconding, but in the present case, the substantive 
piece of evidence in the shape of an ocular account has been disbelieved; 
therefore, no conviction can be based on absconsion alone.
ii) Delay in lodging the first information report often results in consultation and 
deliberation, which is a creature of an afterthought. The prosecution failed to 
explain the delay in reporting the incident and the delay in conducting a post mortem examination of the dead body of deceased. Hence, these circumstances 
raise considerable doubt regarding the veracity of the case and suggests delay in 
reporting the incident in lodging the first information report which is fatal to the 
prosecution’s case... 
iii) Thus, it was established from the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 that PW 
informed the police about the incident and said witness was given up being un necessary, therefore, an adverse inference is to be drawn within the meaning of 
Article 129 (g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 that had the witness PW, been 
appeared in witness box, then his testimony would have been un-favourable to the

circumstances are to be kept in view to accept the ocular evidence of chance 
witnesses?
iii) Whether motive is a double-edged sword that cuts both sides and it can be a 
ground to hold the accused guilty?","i) The evidential value of the First Information Report will be reduced if it is 
made after the unexplained delay, particularly when it creates a suspicion that the 
informant had sufficient opportunity to concoct a story and falsely implicate the 
accused.
ii) The evidence of chance witnesses can be accepted. The statements of such 
witnesses adequately explain the presence of witnesses, and such evidence stands 
the test of caution and scrutiny. It can only be relied upon if the proof has a ring 
of truth and is cogent, credible, and trustworthy. Similarly, the conduct of the 
chance witnesses is also a relevant factor while appreciating his evidence. The 
occasion for the presence at the time of occurrence, the opportunity to witness the 
crime, the normal conduct of the witness to the victim, and his predisposition 
towards the accused, are some of the circumstances to be kept in view to weigh 
and accept the ocular evidence of chance witnesses. It is not the quantum of the 
evidence but the quality and credibility of the witnesses that lends assurance to 
the court for acceptance.
iii) Motive is a double-edged sword that cuts both sides/ways. If, on the one hand, 
it provided a motive for the accused to commit the occurrence in question, on the 
other hand, it equally provided to the first informant to implicate his rival. Based 
on the motive to commit the crime, the accused cannot lead a judgment of 
conviction. Prove of motive by itself may not be a ground to hold the accused 
guilty","i) The evidential value of the First Information Report will be reduced if it is 
made after the unexplained delay.
ii) The evidence of chance witnesses can be accepted and conduct, presence at the

predisposition towards accused are some circumstances to be kept in view to

Direct tax is one, burden of which cannot be shifted to someone else, but for indirect tax, it can be to end consumer. Direct taxes are primarily taxes on a natural person’s net income or net worth. Taxes on net income are based on the taxpayer’s ability to pay and taxes on net worth are levied on the total value of his assets owned, minus liabilities. Indirect taxes are levied on the production or consumption of goods and services or on transactions, including imports and exports. iii) The event or incidence of all kinds of taxation, direct or indirect, is to be decided by the legislature through enactment, influenced by political, economic, and social factors, as well as international agreements and treaties. The incidence of taxation also determines whether the tax is on a person, property or a transaction. Taxes on a person or property are generally direct taxes, and tax on transaction is indirect for it goes with the transaction and falls where the transaction terminates. iv) The Constitution of Pakistan recognizes the power of taxation, as basic characteristic of sovereignty, under its Article 7, with only condition that the state should be ‘empowered by law’ to impose any tax or cess. The condition is reiterated in Article 77 as is reflected in its caption “Tax to be levied by law only”. Article 142 bestows legislative competence upon the Federation and the Provinces. The Federation has exclusive power to impose tax, through legislation, with respect to the kinds and nature of taxes mentioned in the Federal Legislative List [means Federal Legislative List in Fourth Schedule as defined in Article 70(4)] (“FLL”) and the taxes not listed therein can only be imposed by the  Provinces. v) After 1962 Constitution till 18th Amendment, immoveable property was always an essential component of Assets, bestowing competence to tax Capital Value of Assets to Federation. The exclusion of immoveable property was only for the purpose of charging Capital Gain Tax. The Capital Gain Tax always was and is a part of income tax, competence of which is under Entry 47, and reason for placing it in Entry 50 was to exclude the immovable property from the definition of Capital Assets, only for the purpose of capital gain. vi) After change in Entry 50 through 18th Amendment, the effect of omitting the phrase, “on capital gains” is that now capital gain is taxable on immoveable property, under Section 37(1) of the Ordinance of 2001, because capital gain is not a tax on property but a limb of income tax, on the receipt or gain by a person on transfer or sale of property and not on the property. vii) There is a difference between taxes on immoveable property and tax on income arising from immoveable property. Burden of income tax, including capital gain tax is on person who receives the income. Whereas burden of taxes on immoveable property is on the property and goes with the property if not taxed before the sale or transfer. Like Estate Tax paid by the estate itself, before assets are distributed to heirs and inheritance taxes are paid by those who inherit property. Gift tax is levied so that the inheritance and estate tax cannot be avoided by transferring property prior to death. In Pakistan, estate tax was charged under Estate Duty Act 1950, which was repealed in 1979, without any debate or deliberation. It was within competence of Federation under Entry 46 ‘Estate Duty on property’ along with Entry 45 ‘Duties in respect of succession to property’. Both the entries, imposing tax on immoveable property, are repealed by 18th Amendment along with the amendment in Entry 50, where after the phrase “taxes on immoveable property” is excluding “taxes” on immovable property and not the immovable property itself from capital assets, value of which is to be taxed under Entry 50. Omission of Entries 46 & 45 along with amendment in Entry 50, collectively shows that all taxes, burden of which is on the immoveable property are excluded from competence of the Federation. viii) The subsection (1A) and impugned Section 7E are inserted through Finance Act 2022, simultaneously. Agriculture land is now part of assets, for the purpose of capital gain tax. Self-owned agriculture land where agriculture activity is carried out is, however, excluded under Section 7E(2)(c), from chargeability of impugned tax. In impugned Section 7E, capital asset is separately defined under subsection (4)(a), which “means property of any kind held by a person, whether or not connect with a business”. However, by sub clause (iv) to the subsection (4)(a), all moveable assets are excluded from the definition of asset. Interestingly, the levy under Section 7E has targeted only immoveable property by excluding all moveable assets from the definition of capital assets. ix) It is important to note that presumptive tax was purely based on or akin to Entry 52 and it is observed, in particular, that Entry 47 does not admit the imposition of presumptive tax because the expression ‘taxes on income’ means  working out of income based on computation under various provisions of the taxing statute. x) The Fair Market Value, before introducing it in Section 7E, is defined in Section 29(3) of the ITO 1979 for the purpose of determining the cost of acquisition to tax Capital Gain under Section 27, where profit and gain from transfer of a capital asset is deemed as income of the year in which transfer took place. Under Section 29(1) & (2), the fair market value is related to the date on which it become property of the assessee or the date of transfer and presumption here is for redetermination of the received profit and gain. Under Section 12(12) certain transactions of assets, like lease or purchase are deemed as income accrued or arise in Pakistan. The Commissioner is given power to determine the cost of acquisition, considering the sale or lease as per market value. The deeming under Section 12(12) is of a consideration of sale, purchase or lease, whereas under Section 7E there is no profit or gain or transfer of the asset, in particular of the immoveable property. xi) Income is defined under Section 2(29) of the Ordinance of 2001, which uses expression “and any amount treated as income” to confer power of presuming income, but the word, “amount” has significance of receiving something, in other words only an amount or receipt can be presumed as income and not a notional fair market value. Since the phrase, “treated to have derived, as income”, used in the impugned Section 7E, fails the test of the principles and the provisions, ibid, to presume anything as income, therefore, it is held that Federal Legislature is not competent, under Entry 47, to treat fair market value of an immoveable property as income. However, to save the legislation, within competence under Entry 50, the principle of reading down is applied and held that the phrase, ibid, shall not be read in subsection (2) as part of Section 7E. xii) The legislature has excluded i) a Shaheed or dependents of a shaheed belonging to Pakistan Armed Forces ii) a person or dependents of the person who dies while in the service of Pakistan armed forces or Federal or provincial government iii) a war wounded person while in service of Pakistan armed forces or Federal or provincial government iv) an ex-serviceman and serving personal of armed forces or ex-employees or serving personnel of Federal and provincial governments, being original allottees of the capital asset duly certified by the allotment authority in clauses (i) to (iv) of Section 7E (2)(d) of Finance Act 2022 from taxing Capital Value Tax but the legislature has ignored the persons, who have inherited the immoveable property but are not capable of paying Capital Value Tax, particularly when the tax is on person and not the property. This omission makes the levy ‘expropriatory and confiscatory’, for those who might have to sell the asset to be taxed, for paying the tax. Equality clause in Article 25, envisages, in light of the judgments, that similarly placed persons or a class should bear, equal burden of a particular taxation; otherwise the persons who are left out and taxed shall bear extra burden of the tax, of those who are excluded from taxation. It offends fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution, hence being discriminatory in nature","i) Taxation is enforced contribution, collected by state, under its sovereign 
authority, to carry into effect its mandates and for performance of manifold 
functions by the governments at Federal, Provincial or Local Government level. 
ii) Direct taxes are primarily taxes on a natural person’s net income or net worth 
and indirect taxes are levied on the production or consumption of goods and 
services or on transactions, including imports and exports.
iii) Generally, taxes on a person or property are direct taxes, and tax on 
transaction is indirect for it goes with the transaction and falls where the 
transaction terminates. 
iv) No, the federation cannot impose the tax on the items not mentioned in the 
Federal Legislative List.
v) After the 1962 Constitution till 18th Amendment; the Capital Gain Tax is 
excluded from Entry 47 and placed in Entry 50 of the Legislative List Part I to 
exclude the immovable property from the definition of Capital Assets, only for 
the purpose of capital gain.
vi) The effect of omitting the phrase, “on capital gains” from the Entry 50 of the 
Legislative List Part I through 18th Amendment is that now capital gain is taxable 
on immoveable property, under Section 37(1) of the Ordinance of 2001 as the 
capital gain is not a tax on property but a limb of income tax, on the receipt or 
gain by a person on transfer or sale of property and not on the property.
vii) After 18th amendment, omission of Entries 45 & 46 along with amendment in 
Entry 50, collectively shows that all taxes, burden of which is on the immoveable 
property are excluded from competence of the Federation. 
viii) By inserting subsection (1A) and Section 7E in the Finance Act, 2022 the 
agriculture land is now part of assets, for the purpose of capital gain tax. 
However, Self-owned agriculture land where agriculture activity is carried out is 
excluded under Section 7E(2)(c) from chargeability of impugned tax.
ix) Entry 47 of the Legislative List Part I does not admits the imposition of 
presumptive tax.
x) Fair Market Value, before introducing it in Section 7E the Finance Act, 2022, 
is defined in Section 29(3) of the ITO 1979 for the purpose of determining the 
cost of acquisition to tax Capital Gain under Section 27, where profit and gain 
from transfer of a capital asset is deemed as income of the year in which transfer 
took place. 
xi) Federal Legislature is not competent, under Entry 47 of the Legislative List, to 
treat fair market value of an immoveable property as income.
xii) Yes, the clauses (i) to (iv) of Section 7E (2)(d) of Finance Act, 2022 of 
excluding some persons from the levy of Capital Value Tax are discriminatory in 
nature and against the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 25 of the 
Constitution",Mr. Justice Shahid Jamil Khan
Haroon Farooq v. Federation of Pakistan & others.,6.44,Criminal law,Lahore High Court,"The petitioner invites this Court to square the provisions of section 124-A of PPC
with Articles 14, 19 and 19A of the Constitution and to hold that since section 
124-A of PPC contravenes and offends the fundamental rights enshrined in these 
Articles of the Constitution it is void in view of Article 8 of the Constitution 
which provides that any law insofar as it is inconsistent with the rights conferred 
by Chapter I Part II of the Constitution shall to the extent of such inconsistency be 
void. ","i) How the offence u/s 124-A PPC is constituted; whether crime under this section 
is distinguished from other offences?
ii) Whether any fundamental right conferred through the constitution can be 
curtailed?
iii) Whether section 124-A PPC contravenes Article 19 of the Constitution of 
Pakistan 1973?
iv) What is the purpose of providing freedom to the press, whether it is linked 
with the freedom of speech?
v) Whether freedom of speech is incomplete without freedom of press?
vi) Whether section 124-A PPC has any impact on freedom of press? 
vii) Why should not a citizen or a member of press be charged with sedition?
viii) Whether any limitation can be imposed on freedom of speech or press?
ix) What will be the effect on media and press if section 124-A of PPC is allowed 
to stand in its present form?
x) Whether the offence of sedition is comprised in any of the exceptions 
mentioned in article 19 of Constitution?","i) The exciting or attempting to excite certain feelings to the authority of the Government is sufficient to constitute the offence. It follows that section 124-A is quintessentially a colonial law and has its genesis in the colonial rule. It was enacted to perpetrate and entrench British rule in the sub-continent. It has to be distinguished from other crimes which are commonly found to afflict a human society. Sedition belongs to the species of offences which had no other purpose but suppression of people’s voices by the colonial masters. ii) Constitutional democracy enshrines fundamental rights which are conferred upon people and the most cherished of those rights is the right to freedom of speech and expression. There cannot be an abridgement of speech unless it falls within the strict confines of the exceptions to Article 19 of the Constitution. iii) S.124-A of PPC requires unpacking to establish that it contravenes Article 19. First and foremost, the offence, as couched, makes serious inroads into the right of freedom of speech and of the press. In a broadly worded provision which gives  wide leeway to a Government, the offence restricts spoken and written words both by the people and the press. This impacts the people in a number of ways. iv) The whole purpose of providing for freedom of press is to enable democracy to flourish by keeping the citizenry informed and which will, in turn, feed into the entire democratic process through the right to vote. Thus both, right to freedom of speech and freedom of press are inextricably linked to each to form a whole and constitute the main planks on which the edifice of democracy rests. The Constitution makers did not merely provide a right to freedom of speech and expression but added a further condition that the press shall be free so that the flow and transmission of information to the citizens may not be censored. v) Right to freedom of speech is incomplete without freedom of press and which in turn, secures the right to have access to information in all matters of public importance. The Constitution guaranteed freedom of speech by Article 19 and lest its significance be lost, enacted Article 19A to confer a right to have access to information in all matters of public importance. vi) S.124-A of PPC seriously dents the right to publish freely by the press and to impart information through different platforms used by media. Any writings on political issues or discourse on matters of public importance may be caught by the mischief of S.124-A of PPC and would have the unpalatable effect of inhibiting free press. vii) The people of this country are the masters and the holders of offices of the Government are the public servants. This situation cannot be rendered topsy-turvy by arming the public servants with the power to stifle the masters. Section 124-A of PPC connotes a stark regression in the protection of right guaranteed by Article 19 and must yield in its favour. Section 124-A of PPC is incompatible with the foundational principles of constitutional democracy and as a relic of past, must be consigned to oblivion. It has no place in a society which relishes new ideas and critical analysis to advance itself. The prohibition of mere criticism of Government that does not invite violence reflects an antiquated view of the relationship between the state and society. viii) Article 19 of the Constitution expressly provides that the right of freedom of speech and expression are subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law and enumerated in Article 19 itself. It permits restrictions to be imposed by law to save the interests expressly mentioned therein and one consequence of making rights subject to restrictions is that restrictions can be imposed to protect only those interests as are expressly mentioned and none other. It follows indubitably that the restrictions must have nexus with one of the expressly mentioned interests and none else. Cases abound where the superior courts have held that if a restriction did not cover the expressly mentioned interests, then that restriction offended against the Constitution and was ultra vires. Exceptions to freedom of expression must be justified as being necessary in a democracy. ix) If section 124-A of PPC is allowed to stand in its present form, the media and the press would also be caught by its mischief and contrary to its role of informing the general public regarding issues of a political nature will be shackled  by its ability to do so by the provisions of section 124-A of PPC which would pose a constant threat to a free press to write freely and to dispense information without any fear of prosecution. In a true constitutional democracy the media and the press owe a duty to the public for dissemination of information. That duty is thrown into jeopardy by the provisions of section 124-A of PPC. x) The offence of sedition enacted through section 124- A of PPC is not comprised in any of the exceptions mentioned in Article 19 of the Constitution. Further section 124-A of PPC abridges and limits political speech which cannot be countenanced in a free constitutional democracy with freedom of speech and press as the core values","i) The exciting or attempting to excite certain feelings to the authority of the 
Government is sufficient to constitute the offence u/s 124-A PPC; crime under 
this section is distinguished from other offences.
ii) There cannot be an abridgement of speech unless it falls within the strict 
confines of the exceptions to Article 19 of the Constitution.
iii) Section 124-A of PPC contravenes Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan 
1973.
iv) The purpose of providing for freedom of press is to enable democracy to 
flourish by keeping the citizenry informed and it is linked with the freedom of 
speech.
v) Freedom of speech is incomplete without freedom of press.
vi) S.124-A of PPC seriously dents the right to publish freely by the press.

Civil Aviation Authority v. Haji Pervez Ahmad Khan & others.,7.11,Civil law,Lahore High Court,"Through this I.C.A, the petitioner has challenged the decision of the learned 
Single Judge whereby writ petition filed by respondents was accepted.","Whether the land acquired under Land Acquisition Act 1894 can be taken back on 
the ground of being lying surplus by the party from whom it was acquired?
","From the bare reading of the provisions of Capital Development Authority 
Ordinance, 1960 it clearly manifests that it contains an independent mechanism 
for the acquisition and the provisions of Land Acquisition Act. 1894 or the rules 
framed thereunder are alien to the scheme provided therein. Even if we assume 
that after vesting of the land in the Civil Aviation Authority by virtue of the 
Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority Ordinance, 1982 the provisions of the Land 
Acquisition Act, 1894 as well as rules framed thereunder would come into play in 
terms of Section 5(8) of the said ‘Ordinance’. As per Rule 14 of the ‘Rules of 
1983’ the power to restore the possession of acquired land to the persons from 
whom it was acquired lies with the Government and that too in the case, when the 
Department of the Government or a local authority for which land was acquired 
proposed to abandon the public purpose for which it was acquired. The 
respondents are claiming restoration of meagre part of acquired land on the 
ground that it has become surplus. Rule 14 ibid thus cannot be stretched in favour 
of the respondents.
The claim of the respondents that land in question has become surplus, is founded 
upon a demarcation report, which has no legal value unless it is weighed after 
recording of evidence. There are only oral assertions to this effect and there is no 
concrete material that the acquiring/beneficiary department did not utilize the land 
for the purpose for which it was acquired. Even otherwise, matter relating to 
return of acquired land cannot be left at the whims of the ex-landowners. 
Allowing the respondents to claim part of acquired land having become surplus 
would open a pandora box and a flood gate for other landowners as well.","The land acquired under Land Acquisition Act 1894 cannot be taken back on the 
ground of being lying surplus by the party from whom it was acquired",Mr. Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf Mr. Justice Sultan Tanvir Ahmad
"United Bank Ltd. etc. v. Chairman, PLAT, Lahore etc.",7.77,Labour Law,Lahore High Court,"While serving as Assistant in the United Bank Limited, respondent No.3 filed a 
grievance petition, before Labour Court praying for grant of two increments on 
account of improving qualification, in terms of the United Bank Limited (Staff) 
Service Rules, 1999. The Grievance Petition filed by respondent No.3 was 
accepted by the Labour Court and the Bank authorities filed an appeal but the 
same was dismissed by the Punjab Labour Appellate Tribunal (PLAT); hence this 
petition.","i) Whether promulgation of PLAT, IRO, 2011 or IRA, 2012 during pendency of 
appeal can affect the jurisdiction of PLAT? 
ii) Whether despite the repeal of relevant law, regarding grant of increments on

examination, the employee can be granted such increments?
iii) Whether High Court can grant a relief in Constitutional Jurisdiction which is 
not covered under any policy/law? 
iv) Whether forum of appeal should take into consideration the findings given by 
a forum against whose decision appeal has been filed?
v) Whether a petition becomes non-maintainable on retirement of incumbent of 
post who on behalf of bank filed the petition?
vi) Whether person holding power of attorney, empowering him to 
institute/defend proceedings before different forums, can file writ petition before 
High Court?","i) IRO, 2011 having been enacted to the extent of Islamabad Capital Territory 
(ICT), same could not unnecessarily be stretched to the rest of the country. As far 
as IRA, 2012 is concerned; suffice it to note that the same came into existence 
during pendency of appeal of the petitioner-bank. According to section 57(2)(b) 
of IRA, 2012, NIRC may, on the application of a party, or of its own motion, 
withdraw from a Labour Court of Province any application, proceedings or appeal 
relating to unfair labour practice. Since the Bank itself allowed PLAT to decide 
the appeal as neither it filed any application for transfer of appeal to NIRC nor the 
same was withdrawn by NIRC on its own, the objection raised by its counsel in 
these proceedings carries no weight, thus, the same is accordingly spurned.
ii) It is of common knowledge that prior to issuance of formal result card, no 
person can be given any benefit merely on the basis of just participation in the 
examination. If the relevant law regarding grant of increments on account of 
improving qualifications is no more alive on the date when result card was issued, 
the employee cannot be held entitled to grant of such increment…
iii) If relief is not covered under any policy/law same cannot be granted by High 
Court in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction.
iv) It is well entrenched by now that appeal is considered continuation of the 
original proceedings and the forum of appeal is bound to decide the matter 
without being influenced by the findings given by a forum against whose decision 
appeal has been filed.
v) A bank falls within the definition of a juristic person, thus, instant petition 
cannot be held non-maintainable just on account of retirement of its President. 
Further an incumbent of a post retires but the designation still subsists.
vi) If a person is empowered through power of attorney to institute/defend 
proceedings before different forums, such person can file writ petition before

transferred then later on objection cannot be entertained regarding jurisdiction.
ii) After repeal of relevant law, regarding grant of increments on account of 
improving qualifications, and that repeal is prior to issuance of result of

Court in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction.
iv) The forum of appeal is bound to decide the matter without being influenced by 
the findings given by a forum against whose decision appeal has been filed.

required to be produced to prove each and every incident of such a transaction, 
but said details are necessary to be pleaded as well.
ii) No party to a judicial proceeding can be allowed to adduce evidence in support 
of a contention not pleaded earlier and the decision of a case cannot rest on such 
evidence.
iii) When no date, time, place or names of witnesses of the oral agreement to sell 
had been mentioned in the pleadings whilst instituting suit seeking decree for
specific performance of oral agreement to sell, then improvements in evidence in 
relation thereto are considered as beyond the pleadings and are believed to

specific performance. Courts must insist for fulfillment at the earliest of all 
requirements so as to ensure that an oral agreement is fully proved. Pleading and 
proving of each and every link and chain of oral transaction is necessary and sine 
qua non. In view of the above, when the basic and initial oral agreement has not 
been proved, which was necessary to be pleaded and proved independently, the 
subsequent events in the shape of purported agreement to sell has no value in the 
eye of law.

inform him about all her assets and liabilities. The spouse (in this case wife) is an 
independent person with all fundamental rights granted under the Constitution,

liabilities to husband, specifically those not acquired through him or not directly 
related to her husband. Even if the assets were originally acquired by wife through 
husband, she is not obliged under law to inform him before further 
transferring/alienating of those assets. Therefore, any omission of assets/liabilities

Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi v. Syed Asim Ghaffar etc,8.63,Criminal Law,Lahore High Court,"The petitioner has filed the application for the extension of time period in his 
protective bail granted by the Court on previous date. The institution branch of the 
High Court raised the office objection on its maintainability on the ground that 
protective bail is a one-time grace and no rule or practice allows for filing a 
second application or an extension of time granted in the first","Whether the protective bail is a one-time grace, therefore, neither a second 
application may be filed nor time granted in the first may be extended?","There is no provision in the Cr.P.C. 1898 for protective/transitory bail. Still, the 
High Courts in our country have invoked section 561-A Cr.P.C. and Article 199 
of the Constitution to accommodate the accused and allow them to approach the 
court concerned for a remedy. The High Courts do not touch the merits of the case 
while considering such requests. Thus, protective bail serves a specific purpose 
and is granted for a fixed time. It is not the same as anticipatory or pre-arrest bail 
granted under section 498 Cr.P.C. When the accused appears before the court 
concerned, it deals with him independently, and protective bail does not 
automatically entitle him to pre-arrest bail. It merely restrains the police from 
arresting the accused for a certain period. So, technically it is not bail. The 
concept of protective/transitory bail is rooted in fundamental rights. Therefore, the 
High Court cannot short shrift an accused’s second request. It must judicially 
assess and determine if he has legitimate grounds to justify it. The High Court 
should ensure that the accused does not obstruct the investigation by playing hide 
and seek with the criminal justice system.

electricity supplied by K-Electric, who have all collectively challenged the 
impugned judgment, passed by the High Court of Sindh, Karachi. Leave was 
granted on 27.11.2020 to consider whether the disputed Corrigendum dated 
22.01.2020 is enforceable against the consumers of K-Electric","i) With whom authority to determine the tariff and adjust electricity based 
subsidies in the tariff lies? 
ii) What is subsidy and how long it remains operative? 
iii) Whether the subsidy merges in tariff? 
iv) Whether subsidy is outcome of decision of NEPRA?
v) Whether the consumer can claim subsidy as a matter of right?
vi) Whether High Court has jurisdiction to calculate the tariff?","i) The Act and the Policy Guidelines, all make clear that NEPRA determines the tariff, be it annual, multi-year or uniform and the Federal Government notifies the tariff. So far as any adjustments to the tariff are concerned, they are also to be made by NEPRA, whether it is under Section 31 of the Act, being a monthly adjustment or under the 2014 Guidelines, being quarterly or bi -annual adjustment. The SOT is also to be issued by NEPRA, detailing the tariff and the charges it contains. Hence, the impugned judgment could not have declared the manner in which K-Electric should charge consumers for peak hours and off-peak hours based on the Federal Government subsidy. This squarely falls within the domain of NEPRA. Furthermore, tariff determination is a complex and technical process, for which, NEPRA has been established. A detailed regime exists with procedures, process and guidelines on tariff determination which in no manner empowers the Federal Government to determine or adjust the tariff. This is the clear mandate of the Act yet for some reason confusion persisted with reference to K-Electric and its uniform tariff, possibly due to its unique nature. However, the 2021 Policy have made clear to the Federal Government that they cannot determine the uniform tariff nor make adjustments to the tariff nor issue any SOT even for K-Electric as this must be done by NEPRA. ii) The Federal Government is well within its right to introduce, modify or withdraw subsidies. This is an integral part of its socio-economic policies, which NEPRA must give effect to as per Section 31 of the Act. So a consumer of electricity is entitled to a subsidy as long as it is offered by the Federal Government and is bound by any modifications or withdrawals made by the Government. To give effect to a subsidy it is built into the tariff, as its obvious outcome is to reduce the price of electricity. So a subsidy is given effect through the tariff. There is no vested right in favour of the consumer with reference to a subsidy, simply because the subsidy is built into the tariff. Effectively, a subsidy is a relief package offered to consumers and remains operative for as long as it is required as per Government policy. iii) In order to take the benefit of the subsidy, it has to be calculated in terms of the tariff, therefore, even if, it is reflected as a part of the tariff or separately it remains a subsidy and does not merge into the tariff. iv) Essentially, it is based on a policy decision of the Federal Government and is not the outcome of a NEPRA determination. As per Section 31 of the Act, NEPRA is guided by government policies and must consider them, which means that it must reflect the subsidy through the tariff. v) There is no vested right in favour of the consumer with reference to a subsidy, simply because the subsidy is built into the tariff. Effectively, a subsidy is a relief package offered to consumers and remains operative for as long as it is required as per Government policy. (…) the Consumers have no vested right to claim the benefit of a subsidy, which is based on Government policies. vi) High Court had no jurisdiction to calculate the tariff as a dispute pertaining to the tariff should be decided by NEPRA.","i) Tariff determination is a complex and technical process, for which, NEPRA has 
been established. Only NEPRA can determine the tariff and adjust electricity 
based subsidies in the tariff. Federal Government notifies the tariff. 
ii) A subsidy is a relief package offered to consumers and remains operative for as

iii) Subsidy even if is reflected as a part of the tariff or separately it remains a

While the market value of the land acquired at the time of possession may be the first matter a Court must take into consideration, it is not the only matter. The Court is bound to consider when a determination has to be made under Section 23 of the LAA 1894. Instead, the other five considerations, from their very text, imply that whenever a Court is to consider the quantum of compensation, it must be duly aware and cognisant of the loss being caused to the landowners due to the Federal or Provincial Government’s exercise of eminent domain under the LAA 1894. ii) Landowners will deprived of their constitutionally-guaranteed proprietary rights under Article 24 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 whenever a government, be it Federal or Provincial, exercises eminent domain under the LAA 1894. iii) The intention of the legislature behind Section 23 is one where a Court, when determining compensation under the said Section, needs to be considerate and sympathetic to those who have been subjected to eminent domain by the government. Section 23 allows the Court to bring landowners, who have been subjected to eminent domain, back to their positions before the eminent domain was exercised. iv) Unlike riba/interest that accrues out of a financial obligation between the parties, the word “interest” in Section 34 of the LAA 1894 is not interest stricto sensu. The interest awarded to landowners under Section 34 is compensatory in nature that allows the Court to compensate the landowners for the financial loss landowners would suffer from the date of acquisition till payment of compensation by the acquiring authority.  v) Unlike a financial transaction, where parties are often assumed to be equal in bargaining power and are deemed to be consenting to a transaction, an exercise of eminent domain cannot in any sense be construed as either a consenting transaction between the parties involved (i.e. the State and the landowners) nor can it be assumed by any stretch of imagination that the state and the landowners are equal in terms of bargaining power. vi) Eminent domain is a unilateral power of the government and no consent from the affected landowners is required under the law before the state can exercise eminent domain under the LAA 1894.","i) A bare perusal of Section 23 shows that according to the LAA 1894, there are

","(i) The conducting of the DNA test of a person, without his consent, infringes his fundamental rights to liberty and privacy guaranteed by Articles 9 and 14 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan...These fundamental rights, are subject to law and can only be interfered with if so regulated by law made by the  legislature. Further, as per the constitutional command of Article 4 of the Constitution, no action detrimental to the liberty, body or reputation of a person can be taken except in accordance with the law, nor can a person be compelled to do that which the law does not require him to do. This being the constitutional mandate, any executive or judicial act taken in respect of the rights to liberty, privacy, body or reputation of a person must be backed by some law. A court order for the DNA test of two persons as a means of identifying their genetic relationships interferes with their right to privacy and liberty. This test can be ordered only either with the consent of the persons concerned or without their consent if permissible under a law. We are aware of certain provisions of criminal law which permit the DNA test of an accused person without his consent, but no civil law has been brought to our notice which allows this test in civil cases without the consent of the person concerned. (ii) It may be pertinent to mention here that in a civil case, if the person upon whom the onus to prove his genetic relationship with another person lies, does not give consent for his DNA test, and thus withholds such evidence, the court may draw an adverse presumption against the claim of such person and presume that such evidence, if produced, would be unfavourable to him, as per Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 1984.

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports can be ignored; how it is vital in

even the exploration and mining of minor minerals has an adverse impact on the

water, loss of habitats and disruption of the ecosystem.

EIA consider the environmental impact of the project but can also include 
standards and initiatives to improve sustainability of the sector. This can be vital 
in projects of mining under the MMD. They also prescribe mitigation measures

(EMP). The EMP provides the basic framework for implementing and managing 
mitigation and monitoring measures. It identifies the environment issues, the risks 
and recommends the required action to manage the impact. This is vital because

orders which find that the Gas Utility Court under the Gas (Theft Control and 
Recovery) Act, 2016 (2016 Act) has exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute disputes 
of consumers.","i) Whether jurisdiction of the Gas Utility Court is exclusive and no other court or 
authority can exercise jurisdiction with respect to all matters that are covered by 
the 2016 Act? 
ii) Whether purposes of both of the statutes, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority 
Ordinance, 2000 and the Gas (Theft Control and Recovery) Act, 2016 are 
different?","i) Section 5(5) clarifies that for matters which fall under the jurisdiction of the 
Gas Utility Court, it enjoys exclusive jurisdiction and no other court or authority 
can exercise jurisdiction with respect to these matters. Section 5(6)(a), however, 
allows the Gas Utility Court or consumer to seek remedy before any other forum 
prescribed under any law which will include OGRA. However, pursuant to this 
provision OGRA does not enjoy concurrent jurisdiction with the Gas Utility 
court… In view of the foregoing, it is clear that while OGRA may entertain 
complaints against a licensee under the Regulations, it does not enjoy concurrent 
jurisdiction with the Gas Utility Court which has exclusive jurisdiction to 
adjudicate upon all matters under the 2016 Act. OGRA is, at best, a dispute 
resolution forum where disputes may be resolved informally, however, the Gas 
Utility Court is a court with all its inherent powers which has the authority to 
adjudicate upon and award punishment against offences made out under the 2016 
Act. 
ii) It is clear that the purposes of both of the statutes under consideration are 
different. The Ordinance was enacted to provide for the establishment of OGRA 
and to define its functions and jurisdiction for regulating its activities. Whereas, 
the 2016 Act was enacted to provide for prosecution of cases of gas theft and 
other offences relating to gas and to provide a procedure for recovery of amounts 
due. Therefore, even though the Ordinance gives OGRA the power to resolve 
dispute of consumers, it is a dispute resolution forum, where the issues provided 
for in the Regulations can be settled amicably by OGRA between the consumer 
and the gas company. It is not a court and cannot prosecute the matter like the Gas 
Utility Court. Consequently, Section 5(6) of the 2016 Act, in our opinion, clarifies 
that the gas company or a consumer may seek any remedy before any court, 
tribunal or forum which may otherwise be available to it under the law, however, 
the Gas Utility Court is the only court which can prosecute cases of gas theft and 
the offences as prescribed under Sections 14 to 19 of the 2016 Act. Accordingly, 
if a consumer does not want to prosecute a case before the Gas Utility Court, they 
may approach OGRA for resolution of their dispute.","i) Jurisdiction of the Gas Utility Court is exclusive and no other court or authority 
can exercise jurisdiction with respect to all matters that are covered by the 2016 
Act.
ii) Purposes of both of the statutes, Ordinance and the 2016 Act are different.

provide a procedure for recovery of amounts due.","Mr. Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Mrs. Justice Ayesha A. Malik"

Digital) through its Chief Executive Officer & another.",1.15,Civil Law,Supreme Court of Pakistan,"Through this petition, the petitioner has challenged the decision of Sindh High 
Court whereby the appeal of the respondent was allowed and the prohibition order 
against the respondent was set aside","Whether Section 27(a) of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority 
Ordinance 2002 (“PEMRA Ordinance”) is an independent and self-governing 
provision or whether its applicability requires the opinion of the Council of 
Complaints in terms of Section 26(2) of the PEMRA Ordinance read with the 
Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Councils of Complaints) Rules 
2010 (“Councils of Complaints Rules”)?","It has also been argued on behalf of PEMRA that the Councils of Complaints 
have no power to receive and review complaints against any “advertisement” 
under Section 26(2), while PEMRA has such power under Section 27(a); 
therefore, the power of PEMRA under Section 27(a) is independent of the 
provisions of Section 26. It is true that the word “advertisement” is not mentioned 
in subsection (2) of Section 26 but it is found mentioned in subsection (5) thereof. 
The omission of this word in subsection (2) of Section 26 appears to be an 
accidental one, as it does not fit within the overall intent of the legislature 
manifested from reading the provisions of Section 26 as a whole. Needless to say 
that the ultimate object of the process of interpretation of a statute is to find out 
what the legislature must have intended and then to give effect to that intent of the 
legislature, and in order to give effect to the manifest intent of the legislature, the 
courts can supply the inadvertent omission of the draftsman by reading the 
necessary words in the statute. Subsection (5) of Section 26 clearly empowers the 
Councils of Complaints to make a recommendation to PEMRA for the action of 
censure or fine against a licensee for violation of the codes not only of 
programmes content but also of advertisements. The provisions of subsection (5) 
of Section 26 thus make the intent of the legislature abundantly clear that it 
intended to confer the power on the Councils of Complaints to receive and review 
complaints against any aspects of programmes or advertisements, which shall be 
so read in subsection (2) of Section 26, in order to give effect to that manifest 
intent of the legislature","Section 27(a) of the PEMRA Ordinance is not an independent and self-governing 
provision; it rather requires for its applicability the opinion of a Council of 
Complaints regarding the objectionable aspect of a programme or advertisement

Ahtisham Ali v. The State,2.22,Criminal law,Supreme Court of Pakistan,"This Criminal Petition for leave to appeal is brought to entreat pre-arrest bail in 
FIR registered under Sections 324, 380, 427, 337-A(i), 337-F(i) and 34 of the 
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860","i) What are the essential requirements to constitute an offence punishable u/s 34 
PPC?
ii) What are the governing principles of a pre-arrest bail?","i) So far as the applicability of Section 34 of PPC is concerned, it lays down the principle of constructive liability whereby if several persons would unite with a common purpose to do any criminal offence, all those who assist in the completion of their object would be equally guilty. The foundation for constructive liability is the common intention in meeting accused to do the criminal act and the doing of such act in furtherance of common intention to commit the offence. In order to constitute an offence under Section 34 PPC, it is not required that a person should necessarily perform any act by his own hand, rather the common intention presupposes prior concert and requires a prearranged plan. If several persons had the common intention of doing a particular criminal act and if, in furtherance of their common intention, all of them joined together and aided or abetted each other in the commission of an act, then one out of them could not actually with his own hand do the act, but if he helps by his presence or by other act in the commission of an act, he would be held to have himself done that act within the meaning of Section 34 PPC. ii) It is a well settled exposition of law that the grant of pre-arrest bail is an extraordinary relief which may be granted in extraordinary situations to protect the liberty of innocent persons in cases lodged with mala fide intention to harass the person with ulterior motives. By all means, while applying for pre-arrest bail, the petitioner has to satisfy the Court with regard to the basic conditions quantified under Section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 Cr.P.C vis à-vis the existence of reasonable grounds to confide that he is not guilty of the offence alleged against him and the case is one of further inquiry. In the case of Rana Abdul Khaliq Vs The State and others (2019 SCMR 1129), this Court held that grant of pre-arrest bail is an extra ordinary remedy in criminal jurisdiction; it is a diversion of the usual course of law, arrest in cognizable cases; it is a protection to the innocent being hounded on trumped up charges through abuse of process of law, therefore a petitioner seeking judicial protection is required to reasonably demonstrate that the intended arrest is calculated to humiliate him with taints of mala fide; it is not a substitute for post arrest bail in every run of the mill criminal case as it seriously hampers the course of investigation. Ever since the  advent of Hidayat Ullah Khan's case (PLD 1949 Lahore 21), the principles of judicial protection are being faithfully adhered to till date, therefore, grant of pre arrest bail essentially requires considerations of mala fide, ulterior motive or abuse of process of law, situations wherein Court must not hesitate to rescue innocent citizens; these considerations are conspicuously missing in the present case. While in the case of Rana Muhammad Arshad Vs Muhammad Rafique and another (PLD 2009 SC 427), this Court has discussed the framework and guidelines for granting bail before arrest under Section 498, Cr.P.C. by the High Courts and Courts of Session. It was held that the exercise of this power should be confined to cases in which not only a good prima facie ground is made out for the grant of bail in respect of the offence alleged, but also it should be shown that if the petitioner were to be arrested and refused bail, such an order would, in all probability, be made not from motives of furthering the ends of justice in relation to the case, but from some ulterior motive, and with the object of injuring the petitioner, or that the petitioner would in such an eventuality suffer irreparable harm.","i) To constitute an offence under Section 34 PPC, it is not required that a person 
should necessarily perform any act by his own hand; rather the common intention

Court was dismissed.

(Regularization of Services) Act, 2009?

Order, 1984?
iii) What is the doctrine of res judicata explicated under Section 11 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, 1908?","i) Section 2(b) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Employees (Regularization of Services) Act, 2009 refers to the definition of “employee” as employment status  of an employee appointed by the Government on ad hoc or contract basis or second shift/night shift, but does not include the employees for project posts, or those appointed on work charge basis, or those who are paid out of contingencies. According to Section 3 of the 2009 Act, only those employees who were appointed on contract or ad hoc basis and were holding the post on December 31, 2008 or till the commencement of the 2009 Act were deemed to have been validly appointed on regular basis. While reading this provision in conjunction with the definition of “employee” provided under the 2009 Act it is lucidly clear that the persons performing their contractual duties for project post or on work charge basis or who are paid out of contingencies were excluded from the definition of employee. Hence by all means the contractual employees performing their duties on project post could not claim regularization in terms of the aforesaid Act. ii) Article 114 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 defines the doctrine of estoppel under which, when a person has by his declaration, act or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative to deny the truth of that thing. iii) The doctrine of finality is primarily focused on a long-lasting and time honored philosophy enshrined in the legal maxim “Interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium” which recapitulates that “in the interest of the society as a whole, the litigation must come to an end” or “it is in the interest of the State that there should be an end to litigation” and latin maxim “Re judicata pro veritate occipitur” which expounds that a judicial decision must be accepted as correct. Once a judgment attains finality between the parties it cannot be reopened unless some fraud, mistake or lack of jurisdiction is pleaded and established. Finality of judgments culminates the judicial process, proscribing and barring successive appeals or challenging or questioning the judicial decision keeping in view the rigors of the renowned doctrine of res judicata explicated under Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. When the controversy attains finality under the doctrine of past and closed transaction, the controversy cannot be reopened by the Court in the second round of litigation which on the face of it is an abuse of process of the Court","i) The contractual employees performing their duties on project post could not

doctrine of estoppel, when a person has by his declaration, act or omission, 
intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and 
to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed in any 
suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative to deny 
the truth of that thing.

identification parade would be fatal for the prosecution case?
iii) What is the difference between the 'robbery' and the 'dacoity'?
iv) What does the word 'conjointly' used in Sections 391/396 PPC indicates?","i) The contradiction in the statement of a witness may be fatal for the prosecution case but minor discrepancy in evidence will not make the prosecution case doubtful. Where discrepancies are of minor character and do not go to the root of the prosecution story and do not shake the salient features of the prosecution version, they need not be given much importance. ii) It is settled law that holding of identification parade is merely a corroborative piece of evidence. If a witness identifies the accused in court and his statement inspires confidence; he remains consistent on all material particulars and there is nothing in evidence to suggest that he is deposing falsely, then even the non holding of identification parade would not be fatal for the prosecution case. iii) Bare reading of Section 391 & 396 PPC makes it manifestly clear that the 'dacoity' can be said to be an exaggerated version of robbery. If five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit robbery it can be said to be committing the 'dacoity'. Therefore, the only difference between the 'robbery' and the 'dacoity' would be the number of persons involved in conjointly committing or attempt to commit a 'robbery'. The punishment for 'dacoity' and 'robbery' would be the same except that in the case of 'dacoity' the punishment of imprisonment for life can be awarded. However, in the case of 'dacoity with murder' the punishment of death has also been provided in the statute. iv) An immediate feature of Sections 391 & 396 PPC which strikes at first reading is that the word “conjointly” has been used in these provisions of law, which  not used anywhere in Pakistan Penal Code except in the afore-said provisions. It appears that this word has been deliberately preferred over the word 'jointly'. 'Conjointly' indicates jointness of action and understanding. Everyone acts in aid of other. 'Conjointly' means to act in joint manner, together, unitedly by more than one person. Thus the use of word 'conjointly' in Sections 391/396 PPC indicates that five or more robbers act with knowledge and consent and in aid of one another or pursuant to an agreement or understanding, i.e., unitedly. The joint reading of Sections 391 and 396 of PPC makes it abundantly clear that for the offence of dacoity, the essential pre-requisite is the joint participation of five or more persons in the commission of the offence. If in the course thereof any one of them commits murder, all members of the assembly would be guilty of dacoity with murder and would be liable to be punished as enjoin thereby","i) Minor discrepancy in evidence will not make the prosecution case doubtful.

unregistered entity (Company). The petitioner was arrested during the inquiry 
proceedings. He had initially sought bail on merits, which was declined by the 
High Court. After some time the petitioner filed a petition before the Judge, 
Accountability Court, seeking bail on the ground of delay in the conclusion of the 
trial, which was refused, and consequently the petition was dismissed. The High 
Court, however, allowed the constitutional petition and extended the concession 
of bail, subject to furnishing bail bonds with two sureties. In addition, the High 
Court made the release of the petitioner subject to surrendering his passport and 
the Cryptocurrency code to the Investigating Officer of the Bureau. His name was

ii) When the court comes to the conclusion that the accused is entitled to be 
released on bail then in such eventuality whether the grant of bail can be made 
subject to any rider or condition that would render the concession of bail granted 
by the court as ineffective or redundant?
iii) What is the primary purpose of granting bail?
","i) It is settled law that bail cannot be withheld as a punishment. The foundational principles of criminal law are the presumption of innocence of an accused and that bail must not be unjustifiably withheld because it then operates as a punishment before being convicted upon conclusion of the trial. Moreover, the conviction and incarceration of a person who is ultimately found guilty upon conclusion of trial can repair the wrong caused by erroneously extending the relief of interim bail but, no satisfactory reparation can be offered to a person who has been wrongly accused for unjustified incarceration at any stage of the case, if in the end a verdict of acquittal is handed down. ii) It is equally settled law that when the court comes to the conclusion that the accused is entitled to be released on bail then in such eventuality the grant of bail cannot be made subject to any rider or condition that would render the concession of bail granted by the court as ineffective or redundant. When a court is satisfied that a case for grant of bail has been made out then refusal to exercise discretion in favour of releasing the accused, subject to conditions described under section 499 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (“Cr.P.C.”) would not be in conformity with the right to liberty and the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.  iii) The primary purpose of granting bail is to ensure attendance of an accused before the court. It also enables the accused, who is presumed to be innocent, to pursue normal activities which are essential for life such as earning a livelihood or taking care of the needs of the family.","i) Bail cannot be withheld as a punishment.

Needless to mention that all courts exercising civil jurisdiction (whether original/ trial, appellate or revisional) under the CPC read with the Civil Courts Ordinance 1962, are referred to as “civil courts.” But as the powers of a civil court have been conferred on the Tribunal for the purpose of deciding appeals, the reference in Section 5(2) of the Act to the powers of a civil court under the CPC is to be taken as a reference to the powers of an appellate civil court under the CPC. And since the Tribunal can interfere with the findings of facts recorded by the departmental authorities, in addition to correcting any legal error committed by them, the appeals filed before it are in the nature of first appeals as provided in the CPC. Thus, the principles governing first appeals under the CPC apply to appeals before the Tribunal, and the powers of the first appellate court under the CPC are available to it. ii) A first appellate court can award the actual costs incurred in appeal as per provision s of rule 35(3) of Order 41, CPC and can also impose special costs in the exercise of its inherent powers under Section 151, CPC if the facts and circumstances of the case necessitate the making of such an order to secure the ends of justice or to prevent the abuse of the process of the court. Therefore, both these powers are also available to the Tribunal while deciding an appeal under the Act. Similarly, a first appellate court can award not only the actual costs incurred on an application under Section 12(2), CPC by virtue of Section 35 read with Section 141, 3 CPC but also compensatory costs under Section 35A, CPC or special costs under Section 151, CPC. Thus, the Tribunal can also exercise these  powers in awarding costs while deciding an application under Section 12(2), CPC or any other application. iii) It may be elaborated that actual costs are awarded by a civil court under Section 35 of the CPC to reimburse the successful party the expenses incurred by him in the assertion or defence of his rights before the court and compensatory costs are granted under Section 35A to compensate him for undergoing unnecessary litigation due to false or vexatious claim or defence made by his opponent. Whereas special costs are imposed, under Section 151, for deterrent purposes on a party who initiates a proceedings, particularly the appellate proceedings, in complete disregard of the obvious factual or legal position, and thereby wastes the precious court time and abuses the process of the court. iv) it is high time that courts and tribunals should regularly exercise their powers to impose reasonable costs to curb the practice of instituting frivolous and vexatious cases by unscrupulous litigants , which has unduly burdened their dockets with a heavy pendency of cases, thereby clogging the whole justice system. The possibility of being made liable to pay costs is a sufficient deterrence to make a litigant think twice before putting forth a false or vexatious claim or defence before court. The imposition of these costs plays a crucial role in promoting fairness, deterring frivolous lawsuits, encouraging settlement, and fostering efficient use of resources: (i) promoting fairness: imposing costs in litigation helps to create a level playing field for both plaintiffs and defendants. By requiring both parties to bear the financial burden of litigation, the system encourages parties to consider the merits of their case before initiating legal action. This helps to ensure that only those with legitimate grievances pursue legal recourse, reducing the possibility of abuse; (ii) deterring frivolous lawsuits: imposing costs can discourage parties from filing baseless or frivolous claims, as the risk of incurring significant financial losses may outweigh any potential gains. This helps to protect defendants from having to defend themselves against meritless claims, reducing strain on the court system and preserving judicial resources; (iii) encouraging settlement: when parties are aware of the potential costs associated with litigation, they may be more inclined to engage in settlement negotiations or alternative dispute resolution methods. This can result in more efficient resolution of disputes, lower costs for all involved, and a reduced burden on the court system; (iv) fostering efficient use of resources: imposing costs in litigation incentivizes parties to focus on the most relevant and important aspects of their case, as both parties will want to minimize their expenses. This can lead to more efficient use of legal resources, including court time and the expertise of legal professionals, and may result in more focused and streamlined proceedings. The practice of imposing costs would thus cleanse the court dockets of frivolous and vexatious litigation, encourage expeditious dispensation of justice, and promote a smart legal system that enhances access to justice by taking up and deciding genuine cases in the shortest possible timeframe","i) Tribunal is deemed to be a civil court and has the same powers as are vested in 
a civil court under the CPC.
ii) Service Tribunal can impose special costs while deciding the service appeal or 
any application including an application under Section 12(2) of the CPC of a civil 
servant.
iii) Actual costs are awarded by a civil court under Section 35 of the CPC to 
reimburse the successful party the expenses incurred by him and compensatory 
costs are granted under Section 35A to compensate him, whereas special costs are 
imposed, under Section 151, for deterrent purposes.
iv) The practice of imposing costs would cleanse the court dockets of frivolous 
and vexatious litigation, encourage expeditious dispensation of justice, and

"Dr. Sayyid A.S. Pirzada v. The Chief Secretary, Services and Administration 
Department, etc.",3.33,Service law,Supreme Court of Pakistan,"Through this civil petition, the petitioner has challenged the order of the Punjab 
Service Tribunal whereby the appeal filed by the petitioner concerning his 
promotion was held not maintainable on procedural grounds rather on merits","Whether the Punjab Service Tribunal has power under the Act to direct the 
departmental authorities to decide the departmental appeal, review or 
representation of a civil servant, which remained undecided for 90 days?","As per Section 4 of the Act, the right to prefer an appeal to the Tribunal can be invoked subject to the fulfilment of two pre-conditions: (i) in case a departmental appeal, review or representation is provided under the law, no appeal to the Tribunal shall lie unless such a remedy is availed by the aggrieved civil servant; and (ii) a period of 90 days has elapsed since such departmental appeal, review or representation has been preferred. Therefore, if the departmental appeal, review or representation of a civil servant is not decided within a period of 90 days, the aggrieved civil servant need not endlessly wait for the decision of the departmental appeal, review or representation and can straight away approach the Tribunal by filing an appeal for the redressal of his grievance. The Act encourages a civil servant to first avail the remedy of departmental appeal, review or representation so that the matter can best be decided at the departmental level. However, if no progress is made on such departmental remedy within 90 days, the Act provides the civil servant with a higher remedy in the shape of an appeal before the Tribunal to agitate his grievance. When the aggrieved civil servant avails the higher remedy of appeal before the Tribunal after the lapse of the prescribed period of 90 days, the departmental remedy of appeal, review or  representation loses its significance and automatically comes to an end. Once the matter is brought before the Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 of the Act, the departmental remedy stands exhausted. Under Section 5 of the Act, the Tribunal on appeal can only confirm, set aside, vary or modify the order appealed against. The Tribunal has no power under the Act to direct the departmental authorities to decide the departmental appeal, application for review or representation of the civil servant, which remained undecided for a period of 90 days.","The Tribunal has no power under the Act to direct the departmental authorities to

bail stage? 
ii) Whether doctrine of parity or rule of consistency in a criminal case can only be 
applied if the case of the accused is analogous in all respects to that of the co accused for considering the grant of bail?","i) At the bail stage, the Court has to tentatively form an opinion by assessing the evidence available on record without going into merits of the case. The deeper appreciation of the evidence cannot be gone into and it is only to be seen whether the accused is prima facie connected with the commission of offence or not. In order to ascertain whether reasonable grounds exist or not the Courts not only have to look at the material placed before them by the prosecution, but see whether some tangible evidence is available against the accused or not to infer guilt. An essential prerequisite for grant of bail by virtue of sub-Section 2 of Section 497 is that the Court must be satisfied on the basis of opinion expressed by the Police or the material placed before it that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accused is not guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment of 10 years. The mere possibility of further inquiry exists almost in every criminal case. The Court is required to consider overwhelming evidence on record to connect the accused with the commission of the offence and if the answer is in the affirmative he is not entitled to grant of bail. ii) The doctrine of parity or rule of consistency in a criminal case elucidates that if  the case of the accused is analogous in all respects to that of the co-accused then the benefit or advantage extended to one accused should also be extended to the co-accused on the philosophy that the “like cases should be treated alike”. The concept of equal justice requires the appropriate comparability of roles and overt act attributed to the co-offenders, but in case of difference or disparity in the roles due allowance cannot be extended to the co-offenders on the perspicacity that different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability and or different circumstances.","i) The deeper appreciation of the evidence cannot be gone into and it is only to be

"Snamprogetti Engineering B.V. thr. its special attorney v. Commissioner of 
Inland Revenue Zone-II, L.T.U, Islamabad, etc.",3.35,Tax Law,Supreme Court of Pakistan,"The petitioner a company incorporated in the Netherlands, entered into an

“engineering services” and filed tax returns for tax years 2007, 2008 and 2009, 
declaring that the income arising from such engineering services was exempt 
from being taxed under the domestic tax regime of Pakistan. The tax returns were 
treated as assessment orders deemed to have been issued in terms of Section 
120(1) of the Ordinance. The department took exception to the exemption claimed 
by the petitioner. Show cause notices were issued to the petitioner. The Assessing 
Officer amended the assessment orders. Tax was consequently ordered to be 
charged on the income which had been declared exempt by the petitioner. The 
decision of the Assessing Officer was set aside by the Commissioner (Appeals) 
which was reversed by the Tribunal and it was then maintained by the High 
Court. Hence, the petitioner seeks leave of Court to appeal against the decision of 
the High Court.","i) What is aim of international taxation treaties and how their provisions can be

iii) How the term ‘permanent establishment’ can be defined under Convention 
signed and enforced by Pakistan and the Netherlands in 1982? 
iv) How time period can be calculated to constitute permanent establishment as 
per clause 4 of article 5 of the Convention, 1982?","i) International taxation treaties aim to avoid and relieve double taxation through equitable (and acceptable) distribution of tax claims between the countries. The purpose of these treaties has significant relevance as to how their provisions are to be interpreted. The reason is that the efficacy of such treaties depends on common and workable interpretation of the treaty terms. Such an interpretation requires taking into consideration the international tax language and terminology and placing reliance on legal decisions and practices in other countries, where appropriate, because these materials form part of the legal context. Model treaties developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the United Nations (“UN”) to provide standard frameworks of guidance for treaty negotiation, and official commentaries thereon, are of high persuasive value in terms of defining the parameters of double taxation treaties and have world-wide recognition as basic documents of reference in the  negotiation, application and interpretation of multilateral or bilateral tax conventions. Most countries accept the common interpretation principles of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23rd May 1969 (“VCLT”) under customary international law, and thus the VCLT and not the domestic law of the contracting states, usually governs the interpretation of such treaties. ii) The Convention involved in the present case was signed and enforced by Pakistan and the Netherlands in 1982. Its Article 7 provides that the business profits of an enterprise of one of the states shall be taxable in the other state only if the enterprise maintains a permanent establishment in the latter state and only to the extent that the profits are attributable to the permanent establishment. iii) The term ‘permanent establishment’ is dealt with under Article 5 of the Convention. The structure of this Article as per the OECD and UN Model Conventions has been explained in Klaus Vogel’s treatise, which is regarded as the international gold standard on the law of tax treaties, as a multi-level structure and can be read from more than one starting point. Clause 1 of Article 5 of the Convention gives a general or classic definition of the term permanent establishment as a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. Clause 2 contains a non-exhaustive list of examples which could be regarded as permanent establishments. Clause 3 expressly provides that a building site, construction, installation, assembly project or supervisory activities constitute a permanent establishment only if they last more than six months. Clause 4 relates to services and provides that the furnishing of services would fall in the ambit of permanent establishment if activities of that nature continue for a period or periods aggregating more than four months within any twelve-month period. Clause 5 lists a number of business activities which are treated as exceptions to the general definition. Clauses 6 and 7 are deeming provisions referring to situations where an enterprise is deemed to have a permanent establishment in one of the states. And, clause 8 provides an instance that a company which is a resident of one of the states and controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other state or which carries on business in the other state shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. iv) The language used in Clause 4 of Article 5 of the Convention with respect to time period shows that there may be a number of periods, interspersed with breaks, during which services are furnished by an enterprise. If the aggregate of these periods crosses the threshold of four months within any twelve-month period, a permanent establishment will stand constituted","i) The aim of international taxation treaties is to avoid and relieve double taxation 
and interpretation of their provisions require taking into consideration the 
international tax language and terminology and placing reliance on legal decisions 
and practices in other countries. 
ii) The business profits of an enterprise of one of the states shall be taxable in the 
other state only if the enterprise maintains a permanent establishment in the latter 
state and the profits are attributable to the permanent establishment.
iii) Permanent establishment means a fixed place of business through which the 
business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on as per clause 1 of article 5 
of the Convention and other clauses give list and instances of permanent 
establishment.
iv) As per clause 4 of article 5 of the Convention, 1982 if the aggregate of these

consideration in a suit seeking specific performance of contract, can be equated 
with cases in which court-fees is not paid or belatedly paid?
iii) Whether judgment should be given without applicable court fee having been 
paid and time given for payment of court fee in judgment?","i) Supreme Court in Provincial Government v Abdullah Jan and in Abdul Khaliq v 
Haq Nawaz held that the Court-Fees Act, 1870 is a taxing statute which collects 
revenue for the State, and that it does not create any right in a party nor 
extinguishes any party’s right. If the court-fees was a right vesting in a party then 
a court could not waive its payment. However, if a person is financially incapable 
of paying court-fees the CPC permits filing of a suit without payment of court fees and the plaintiff therein is enabled to submit an application under Order 
XXXIII of the CPC to sue as a pauper, that is, without paying court-fees; there is 
no reason not to apply the same principle to appeals too. If payment of court-fees 
had created a right in the opposite-party the law would not have permitted 
entertaining an application (under Order XXXIII CPC) seeking permission to sue 
as a pauper and file a suit without court-fees nor empowered the court to grant 
such application.
ii) The cases in which money is due to the opposite-party, such as sale 
consideration in a suit seeking specific performance of contract or a statutory 
provision requiring deposit of the amount in a preemption suit to secure the 
interest of the purchaser, cannot be equated with cases in which court-fees is not 
paid or belatedly paid; payment of court-fees is not received by the opposite party. Non-payment or belated payment of court-fees does not adversely affect the 
interest of the opposite party.
iii) Legal complications arise if a judgment is given without applicable court-fees 
having been paid, and parties alter their positions pursuant thereto, for instance 
the appellant may have proceeded to sell the land which he had purchased and 
thus create third-party interest therein, which may give rise to additional 
litigation. Such litigation can be avoided if the matter of court-fees is first settled. 
Moreover, when courts are inundated with cases, and of those who are keen to 
proceed with them, it does not stand to reason to waste court-time by deciding a 
case in which court-fees has not been paid.

"Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA), Islamabad v. 
Pakistan Broadcasters Association and another",4.41,Civil Law,Supreme Court of Pakistan,"This civil appeal is filed against the judgment of High Court of Sindh, whereby 
the constitutional petition moved by the respondents was accepted and the 
authority to delegate power of suspension of Broadcast Media licences to the 
chairman PEMRA was strike down.","What is the legal requirement to delegate power of suspension of a Broadcast 
Media licence under section 13 read with section 30 of the PEMRA Ordinance 
2002 to the chairman PEMRA","The first proviso had expressly disallowed delegation of four kinds of powers: the 
grant, suspension, revocation or cancellation of a broadcast licence. The 
amendments of 2007 reduced the disallowed powers to three, the power of 
suspension being excluded. In other words, the power to suspend the licence can 
now be delegated. The power of suspension, especially in the context of the 
provision of subsection (3) of s. 30 whereby such power can be exercised without 
prior notice or hearing “for reason of necessity in the public interest” is simply too 
powerful and broad an instrument to be entrusted to anyone other than where the 
statute places it (i.e., in the hands of the Authority itself) on a ground so flimsy as 
the desire to take “prompt action”. In the context of a power to suspend a licence 
without prior notice or hearing, both “public interest” and “necessity” can be 
rather malleable terms either of which can be bent hither or thither. The need or 
desire to take “prompt action”, even if legally sustainable, is not to be confused or 
equated with the “necessity” to take action, especially when such necessity can 
only exist in the context of public interest. A strong case must be made out and 
there must be very serious application of mind by the Authority for it to be 
satisfied that the power of suspension ought to be delegated. Even if the power of 
suspension is delegated to the Chairman for legally valid and sustainable reasons, 
the “threshold” for not exercising its “discretion” in relation to the imposition of 
conditions in relation to such delegation is so high that, as explained, it effectively 
vanishes. Conditions had to be imposed, and that had to be done by rules.

after proceeding with the defendant ex parte, may determine the rights of the
parties either without recording evidence or may call the plaintiff to produce 
evidence, in order to satisfy itself on arriving at a proper conclusion of the matter 
presented before it, for the safe administration of justice. Thus, despite non–
appearance of the defendant, the Court should not act mechanically, rather ought 
to consider the legal and factual aspects of the case, on the basis of the material 
available before it.

adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively

that any such document required by law to be attested by two witnesses shall not 
be used as evidence, save for two attesting witnesses appear before the Court to 
prove its execution, unless the same is admitted by the contesting parties, as 
stipulated by Article 81 of the Order, 1984. If the question of execution and 
attestation of any such document is put in issue by the Court, the party relying

such documents executed between private and/or public parties as well as in cases

those powers are properly used. It may acquire, hold and dispose of property, both 
movable and immovable, and may sue or be sued. The day-to-day control of the 
administration is vested in the Chairperson assisted by other officers. It makes its 
own appointments and has its own recruitment rules. It has an independent 
account. Its Chairperson, members and officers, servants, consultants and advisers 
are public servants. All these attributes make it clear that although the Higher 
Education Commission is owned and funded by the Government, and its 
Chairperson and members are appointed by the Prime Minister, it is, in the eye of

has to prove that the notice has been delivered to all the defendants. The service

is avoiding getting their evidence recorded. While deciding bail petition on 
statutory grounds, the courts must examine the available material to first form an 
opinion that such delay is not occasioned due to any act of the accused himself or 
any other person acting on his behalf. If that be so, the bail even on the ground of 
statutory delay can be declined. The learned High Court has correctly appreciated 
the material aspects of the case and the conclusions drawn are in line with the 
guidelines enunciated by this Court on the subject. Learned counsel for the

vi) Whether caretaker government can make appointments of law officers?
vii) What will be the effect if there is inconsistency in provisions of two 
independent statutes of same field?
viii) What does expression “public interest” used in Elections Act, 2017 means?","i) The word caretaker Government is a government temporarily in power until the election is held. It is a temporary Government commissioned by the Governor General or State Governor, usually for a short period until the stable Government can be formed. Caretaker governments are established during the time of  uncertainty when it is not clear whether any party or coalition of parties is capable of forming a stable government. ii) Caretaker chief minister is the Chief Executive of the Province and discharges his duties under the Constitution and the Election Act, 2017. He is supposed to be a strong Chief Executive of the Province as he is assigned an onerous duty to thoroughly implement the policy of Election Commission in the Provinces to hold fair, free and transparent elections having approval by the public-at-large. iii) Caretaker governments carry on the routine business of government, but they are expected to refrain from making important policy decisions. The caretaker Government is not entitled to make promotions or major appointments of public officials but may make acting or short-term appointments in public interest and that the caretaker Government has to restrict itself to the activities that are of routine, noncontroversial and urgent in nature that too in the public interest, revisable by the future Government elected Government. iv) In order to interpret Section 230 of Election Act, 2017, preamble of Election Act, 2017 reference can be made to preamble of the Act, according to which it was expedient to amend, consolidate and unify laws relating to the conduct of elections and matter connected therewith or ancillary thereto. It deals with de limitation of Constituencies, Elected rolls, Conduct of Elections in the Assemblies, Senate, Falling of Election Expenses, Resolution of Election Disputes, Formation of Political Parties, Allocation of Symbols, Conduct of Elections of the Local Government and Chapter XIV deals with the related other matters. v) The Advocate-General has been defined in Clause 1.5 of the Law Department Manual. Article 140 of Constitution of 1973 has empowered the Governor regarding the appointment of Advocate-General. An Advocate-General is appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister under the powers given in Clause 4 of Part-A of Third Schedule under Rule 13 of the Punjab Government Rules of Business, 2011 read with Clause 16 of the Seventh Schedule Part-A made under Rule 14(1) of the Punjab Government Rules of Business, 2011. vi) It is the exclusive domain of Caretaker Chief Minister to make appointments of law officers as per qualification and disqualification prescribed under the law. vii) It is settled law that where two statutes operate in the same field independently, though they may contain different provisions in this behalf, if by giving effect to the provisions, one of the provision of the other enactment are rendered or are likely to be rendered nugatory, the two statutes clashes and are inconsistent, then the provisions of later statute to the extent of grounds covered or intended to be covered will supersede and displace the other statute. This principle is based on maxim leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant. It means that the latest expression of the will of the legislature must prevail. viii) Expression “public interest” is not capable of precise definition and has no strict meaning but it takes colour from the statute in which it occurs. When the above rule of interpretation is applied to the words “public interest” used in FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN 19 Elections Act, this indeed means that public interest in this case is to ensure honest, just, free and fair elections in accordance with law, which is also the mandate of Articles 218 to 224 & 224-A of the Constitution.","i) Caretaker Government is a temporary Government commissioned by the

","i) Does there exist any impediment in the way of Family Court in adopting the 
procedure provided in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for purpose of execution 
of a decree?
ii) Whether Family Court is entirely a different entity or it has some nexus with 
Civil Court?
iii) How the proceedings/petitions for execution of decree pending before Judge 
Family Court can be transferred to some other place for satisfaction thereof?","i) Section 6 of Family Courts Act, 1964 confers power of supervision of a Family 
Court to District Judge same as that of Civil Court in the respect of district and 
Section 13 (4) of Act ibid clearly manifests that a Civil Court is at par with the 
Family Court at least for the purpose of execution of the decree. 
ii) The West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965 were framed to carry out the 
purpose of the Family Courts Act, 1964, Rule 3 whereof ordains that courts of the 
District Judge, the Additional District Judge, the Civil Judge, the President of the 
Majlis-e-Shoora Kalat and the Qazi appointed under the Dastur-ul-Amal diwani 
Riasat Kalat, shall be the Family Courts for the purposes of the Act ibid. Rule 7 of 
the West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965 prescribes that suits triable under 
the Act ibid shall be instituted in and tried by the Court of the Civil Judge having 
jurisdiction under rule 6 and if there is no such court in any District, then such 
suits shall be instituted in and tried by the Court of the District Judge or the 
Additional District Judge. Furthermore, Rules 15 to 21 of the West Pakistan 
Family Courts Rules, 1965 eliminate any element of distinction between a Family 
Court and Civil Court for the purpose of registering of cases, decrees & orders 
etc. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, except its Sections 10 & 
11, have been ousted to the proceedings before the Family Court vide Section 17 
of Act ibid. The prime purpose of such ouster clause is to avoid procedural 
formalities likely to operate as hurdle in the speedy and swift decision of disputes 
brought before the Family Court. Hence, there is no notable difference between 
Family Court and Civil Court. Therefore, general procedure for both the courts 
would remain almost the same until something is specifically barred or amounts 
to cause a serious prejudice to any of the party.
iii) Both provisions of Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and 
Section 25-A of the Family Court Act, 1964 deal with transfer, entrustment or 
withdrawal of the proceedings from one court to another. Said powers in the case 
of former provision vest with High Court or the District Court, whereas in the 
latter it falls within the domain of the High Court and the Hon’ble Supreme Court. 
Section 38 of the Code ibid lays down that a decree may be executed either by the 
court which passed it, or by the court to which it is sent for execution. Once a 
decree is passed by the Family Court, it becomes executable in terms of Section 
13 of Act ibid. Section 13 (4) of Act ibid places the Family Court and the Civil 
Court at the same pedestal for the purpose of execution of decree, so in that 
capacity a court “Family” or “Civil” enjoys all powers of the executing court 
vested in Part II as well as Order XXI of the Code ibid","i) There exists no impediment in the way of Family Court to adopt the procedure 
provided in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 to foster the justice in proceedings 
for execution of a decree.
ii) There is no marked distinction between a Family Court and the Civil Court.

(viii) What is meant by Tazkiya-Al-Shuhood?
(ix) What is the mode and manner of carrying out the essential requirement of 
Tazkiyah-Al-Shuhood?","(i) The medical evidence in a charge of murder has its own importance and is collected with the sole purpose of enabling the Court for reaching the truth. The doctor who examines the injured or the deceased, in fact makes contribution in the administration of criminal justice. From the medical data placed on record, the court gets an overview about the truth of eyewitnesses in reference to the  locales of injuries, the kind of weapons used for the crime, the duration within which the traumas were inflicted and above all the actual cause of death. (ii) In legal parlance the word “corroborate” means to strengthen, confirm or to make more certain and this is how the term is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary, Tenth Edition. The corroboration can be sought from some other independent circumstances or evidence which though does not directly prove the ultimate guilt of a delinquent but inclines to connect him with the commission of crime. (iii) Islamic Jurisprudence provides various kinds of punishments which can be summarized as Hadd, Qisas and Ta’zir. The word “Hadd” in its literal sense means the punishments of crimes as ordained in Holy Quran. The offences which come within the purviewof “Hadd” include intoxication through consumption of liquor bymouth, Theft/Haraabah, Zina, Qazf and Apostasy. If the quantum and quality of evidence for proving these offences is available in accordance with the Injunctions of Islam, then the delinquents are tobe punished with the quantum of sentence as ordained by Almighty Allah and no deviation can be made therefrom by the Qazi/Court. So far as the Qisas is concerned, it means equal retaliation through retributive justice… The basic difference between Hadd and Qisas is to the effect that the former fundamentally is the right of Allah Almighty and no compromise, settlement, pardon or waiver is permissible, whereas the latter is the right of victim (if injured) or the legal heirs/wali (in the case of murder) and can be compounded or waived. In so far as Ta’zir is concerned, it is a kind of punishment which can be awarded through the laws of an Islamic State for other offences and in respect of delinquencies in which requisite proof for inflicting Hadd is lacking. (iv) We need to shed light on the point that through the necessary implication of Article 10(1) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, a person burdened with the allegation of having committed crime has an unfettered right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. Similar right is bequeathed to an accused under Section 340(1) of Cr.P.C…For ensuring the afore-mentioned right of an accused facing criminal charge, the needful is done through Rule 1 of the High Court Rules and Orders Volume-III, Chapter 24…The High Court Rules and Orders Volume-V, Chapter-4 Part-D further speaks that in cases of conviction having capital sentence, if the convict cannot engage a counsel for his defence, the Deputy Registrar shall take appropriate steps for providing such services at Government expense in appeals. Another provision of High Court Rules and Orders Volume-V Chapter-4 Part-E is a step forward in this regard and it is provided therein that if an accused is being tried by High Court in its original jurisdiction for an offence entailing capital punishment and he is incapacitated to afford the services of a legal practitioner, he can get such assistance at State expense…It can safely be captured that where in subsequent trial a convict was being defended by a legal practitioner but at the time of his indictment it was not so then the statement made by such convict cannot be used to his detriment or disadvantage and more importantly as a necessary proof of qatl-i-amd liable to Qisas in accordance with Section 304(1) Cr.P.C.  (v) It would be in fitness of things to observe here that the examination of an accused under section 342 Cr.P.C. after the closure of prosecution evidence is not a mere formality but a legal requirement, which in no manner can be dispensed with. The primary purpose of such an examination is to apprise an accused with all the circumstances which are incriminating in nature, so as to enable himor her to address them properly. The law is settled that if the accused, facing trial is not confronted with such incriminating circumstances, no conviction can be awarded on the basis thereof. (vi) We have no doubt in our minds that if the accused pleads guilty under Section 265-E Cr.P.C. but the Court does not award him punishment and instead proceeds with the trial then such confession cannot be used to the detriment of the accused subsequently. (vii) It can be derived from Section 304(1)(b) P.P.C that punishment of Qisas can be awarded if the proof in the form of Article 17 of QSO, 1984 is available… The combined effect of reading Article 17(1)of QSO, 1984 in conjunction of Sections 304(1)(b) & 338-F P.P.C is to the effect that punishment of death as Qisas can be awarded if the witness fulfills the requirement of “Tazkiyah-Al-Shuhood” which is a concept emanating from the Islamic law. (viii) The term “Tazkiyah-Al- Shuhood” comprises upon two words, one out of which is Tazkiyah which means purifying, screening or separating the good from the bad, whereas Shuhood stands for the witnesses to be produced during trial of a case. According to Quranic commandments, a Muslim is to speak nothing but truth even if it goes against him. (ix) Chapter XVI of P.P.C, even after having been reshaped in accordance with cases reported as Gul Hassan Khan v. Government of Pakistan and another (PLD 1980 Peshawar 1), Muhammad Riaz, etc. v. Federal Government, etc. (PLD 1980 FSC 1) and Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Law and another v. Gul Hassan Khan (PLD 1989 Supreme Court 633) is in eternal silence about the mode and manner of carrying out the essential requirement of Tazkiyah Al-Shuhood…Due to the legislative defect so mentioned above, Tazkiyah-Al Shuhood always remained a problematic question for the Courts and no judicial consensus could be developed about the procedural requirement to give it a practical effect. As per Islamic law Tazkiyah-Al-Shuhood can be carried out through open as well as by secret proceedings as is mentioned in Islam Ka Qanun-e-Shahadat (Volume 1) by S.M.Mateen Hashmi (pages 146, 149 & 308). We are mindful of the fact that a prosecution witness will always be reluctant to lift veil from his own misdeeds of having been involved in major sins, thus requirement of Tazkiyah-Al-Shuhood are to be fulfilled through a separate inquiry. Such practice, if given effect, will give rise to the proceedings involving the recording of the statements of various persons regarding the character of a witness before the commencement of actual trial for the offence.","(i) The medical evidence in a charge of murder enables the Court to reach the truth.

ii) Whether executing Court/Family Court is competent to transfer the execution 
petition within District or outside the District?
iii) Whether only High Court is empowered to transfer suit, proceedings from one

","i) Family Courts Act, 1964 is a special law enacted to provide facilities to litigants 
in Family matter. The Family Court has power to pass any order to meet the ends 
of justice and also has power to take steps for substantial justice.
ii) The Family Court Act is a special law and the Family Judge is competent to do 
the needful for substantial justice, however, the CPC in stricto senso is not 
applicable to the proceeding before Family Court. Thus, the learned executing 
Court/Family Court is not competent to transfer the execution petition within 
District or outside the District and if it does so, it would be violation of Section 
25-A of the Family Courts Act, meaning thereby the Family Court is not 
competent to issue any precept under Section 46 CPC for the attachment of any 
property rather it shall adopt the procedure mentioned under Section 80 of the 
Land Revenue Act, 1967.
iii) Under Section 17 read with 25-A of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act,

for issuance of directions to respondents No. 2 for entertaining the application of 
the petitioner on behalf of his real daughter in the light of minority quota and

Institutes for religious minorities under the Punjab Minorities Empowerment 
Package can be extended to admission in educational institutions?
ii) Whether any person can represent another without the knowledge or against the 
wishes of the other person?","i) The policy decision of the Government through afore-noted notification dated 
18th May 2020 reserving 2% quota in Public Sector High Education Institutes for 
religious minorities under the Punjab Empowerment Package has been made 
applicable to candidates who apply to join government service and not for 
candidates who seek admission to educational institutions as students. This fact 
has been also affirmed by the Counsel for the respondent-UHS. Nothing has been 
placed on the record to show that the afore-referred notification was extended to 
admissions of students in educational institutions especially MBBS and BDS 
students. This court cannot extend the policy decision of the government taken in 
service matter in Educational institutions to be applicable to admissions of 
students to said educational institutions or other such institutions as this Court 
cannot take the role of policy maker and substitute policy framed by the competent 
authority by policy of its own.
ii) The vires of the notification/policy or law have also not been called in question 
for which the appellant could claim to have locus standi to file the constitutional 
petition and appeal. Even the prayer of the constitutional petition already 
reproduced above shows that the appellant seeks direction to the respondents to 
entertain his application on behalf of his daughter, which shows that the 
appellant’s daughter has not filed any application with the respondents for redress 
of grievance. The entire proceedings have been initiated by the appellant without 
any apparent authority to represent his daughter in the said proceedings whereas 
no law authorized any person to represent another without the knowledge or

admission during judicial proceedings?
ii) What is the Doctrine of Approbate and Reprobate?
iii) Whether miscellaneous applications must be decided before determination of a 
controversy in all eventualities?
","i) An admission/ statement/ undertaking, by a party, during the judicial
proceedings has to be given sanctity while applying the principle of legal 
estoppel and estoppel by conduct as well as to respect moral and ethical rules.
Hence, at any subsequent stage, a party cannot turn around to wriggle out from 
the consequence of such admission. If disclaimer therefrom is allowed as a matter 
of right, then it will definitely result into distrust of the public litigants over the
judicial proceedings. Article 114 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 provides
that when a person has by his declaration, act or omission intentionally caused or
permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, 
neither he nor his representative is allowed in any suit or proceedings between
the parties to deny the truth of that thing. This provision enacts a rule of 
evidence whereby a person is not allowed to plead contrary to a fact or a state of 
thing which he formerly asserted as existing and made the other party to
believeit as such and then acted on it on such belief. In fact, this principle is 
founded on equity and justness with straightforward objective to prevent fraud
and ensure justice.
ii) The Latin maxim “Qui Approbat non Reprobat” quite literally translates to 
“the one who approbates, cannot reprobate” or “that which I approve, I
cannot disapprove”. The Doctrine of Approbate and Reprobate was established 
upon the Scottish laws and is now an essential principle of equity. To approve or 
reject anything is to approbate or reprobate. A person cannot approbate and
reprobate something simultaneously, according to the law. The Doctrine of 
Approbate and Reprobate is also commonly known as the ‘Doctrine of Election’
in English Law. The Doctrine of Election bases itself upon the maxim
“Allegans contraria non est audiendus” which means when people make 
comments that contradict one another, they will not be heard.
iii) It is not persistent rule that in all eventualities, the miscellaneous applications 
ought to have been decided before final determination of the controversy
because this principle is adhered to for the sake of justice. If the matter is
otherwise conclusively determined by the Court, the sole factum of indecision
of some application(s) shall not frustrate the proceedings/ verdict of the Court","i) A party cannot turn around to wriggle out from the consequences of its 
admission during judicial proceedings.
ii) The Doctrine of Approbate and Reprobate envisages that as per law a person
cannot approbate and reprobate something simultaneously.
iii) It is not persistent rule that in all eventualities, the miscellaneous applications 
ought to have been decided before final determination of a controversy.

Thus, the presence and extent, or absence of rigor mortis helps to provide a rough estimate of the time since death. As for example, if rigor mortis has not set in, the time since death would be within 2 hours and if it has developed, the time since death would be within about 12-24 hours. iii) If eyewitnesses have themselves opted to narrate exact locale of the entry wounds in their statements and same is not confirmed by medical evidence, then none-else but prosecution has to suffer. iv) It is well settled that witness who introduces dishonest improvement for strengthening the case, cannot be relied. v) It is trite of law that witness who denies admitted facts cannot be termed as reliable witness.  vi) Testimony of a chance witness is “suspect” evidence and cannot be accepted without pinch of salt. vii) As far as motive is concerned, it is notable that in case of murder of a person by his trusted/closely related person, if any cause of murder is alleged/claimed by the prosecution, same attains vital importance. But when substantive piece of evidence in the form of ocular account has been disbelieved, then motive is of no help to the case of prosecution as the same loses its efficacy. viii) So far as abscondance of the appellant is concerned, suffice it to say that it has to be proved like any other fact, however, when warrant of arrest reveals that it was not issued to any police officer or public servant for execution, similarly, it has not been mentioned in the proclamation that in how much period or till which date, accused had to surrender; therefore, both warrant and proclamation are considered defective, and mandatory requirements in the same have not been fulfilled and prosecution could not prove this limb of its case. It is important to mention here that abscondance is not proof of the charge..","i) Upon “opinion of expert” the Court shall make its opinion while preferring the 
settled principles on the subject found in relevant treatises.
ii) The estimated time since death would be within 2 hours if rigor mortis has not

iv) Whether in extreme cases where the Code of Criminal Procedure places an 
embargo on the Provincial Government (like the offences under Chapter XVI of 
the PPC), it may forward the case to the President with a request to consider it for 
remission or commutation of sentence under Article 45 of the Constitution?","ii) Article 45 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardon, reprieve and respite, and remit, suspend or commute any sentence passed by any court, tribunal or authority. In paragraph 26 of the aforementioned judgment the FSC expressly stated that it had no jurisdiction to examine any provision of the Constitution in view of Article 203-B(c) so it could only “advise” the President to keep the above principles in mind while exercising those powers. ii) The legal position that emerges from the above discussion is that the authority granted to the President by Article 45 of the Constitution is on a high pedestal. It is separate from the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, and is not subject to its syncopation or that of the other subsidiary statutory or executive provision. Hence, section 402-C Cr.P.C. insofar as it clogs that authority is ultra vires the Constitution and has no force. iii) The Petitioner is undergoing a life sentence for the murder of Muhammad Yaqub. He made an application under section 401 Cr.P.C. to the Additional Chief Secretary for suspension/remission of his punishment which was not maintainable because the legal heirs of the deceased had not given consent in terms of section 402-C Cr.P.C. Nevertheless, the Additional Chief Secretary treated it as a request for parole under section 2 of the Probational Release Act. There can be no objection to it. The said section empowers the Provincial Government to release a prisoner by license on the conditions imposed if his antecedents or conduct in prison reflects that he is likely to abstain from crime and lead useful and industrious life when released from prison. The Good Conduct Prisoners’ Probational Release Rules, 1927 (the “Probational Release Rules”), supplement the Act. Even though the object of these provisions is the rehabilitation of the convict in society after his release and not medical parole, the Government may legitimately entertain an individual’s application if he qualifies thereunder. vi) The prisoners suffering from a serious illness and those who are old and infirm have a right to be considered for premature release. The Jail Superintendents are obligated to report such cases to the Inspector General of Prisons who should  submit them to the Provincial Government for appropriate orders. In extreme cases where the Code of Criminal Procedure places an embargo on the Provincial Government (like the offences under Chapter XVI of the PPC), it may forward the case to the President with a request to consider it for remission or commutation of sentence under Article 45 of the Constitution.

Section 20  of the Act, 1912, governs the succession to the tenancy rights of the original tenant whereas, section 21 of the Act, 1912, contains the rule of successions of the tenant who inherited the same from the original tenant. The rules of succession contained in clauses “a”, “b”, & “c” of Section 20 of the Act, 1912 provide that a widow inherited the tenancy under Section 20(b) in the absence of male lineal and is subject to the condition that she will hold the estate only till she remarries or dies or otherwise losses her right under the provisions of the Act, 1912.

","i) Whether the language, legislator applied to draft the offence of ‘Sexual abuse’ 
contains each and every thing in a boat for its omnibus sailing on all sorts of acts
which makes its applicability difficult?
ii) Whether the words used in section 377-A PPC for describing different types of 
offences required different sentencing zones to meet principles and purposes of 
sentencing?
iii) Whether the definition of “Sexual abuse” under section 377-A PPC can be 
termed as a bad piece of legislation, open to exploitation very easily?
iv) Whether graver offence would engulf the minor under the doctrine of merger?","i) The language, legislator applied to draft the offence of ‘Sexual abuse’ contains 
each and every thing in a boat for its omnibus sailing on all sorts of acts and that 
too without the definition of terms used for explaining such offences in one 
section of law which not only makes its applicability difficult but creates 
problems for investigators/ prosecutors and the courts to propose particular charge 
or to find out standards to evaluate the charge for appropriate sentences. While 
proposing sentence for all sorts of acts mentioned in the section, legislator has 
completely failed to attend the sentencing principles and purposes.
ii) The words used in section 377-A PPC for describing different types of offences 
require different sentencing zones to meet principles and purposes of sentencing, 
but legislator has not taken care of such requirement which is causing serious 
prejudice, damage and injustice to oppressed people who are easy prey for false 
implication as scapegoat. So much so legislator has not defined the words 
‘fondling, stroking, caressing, exhibitionism, voyeurism’ used in section 377-A 
PPC, therefore, its self-interpretation can produce inconsistent approaches to reach 
out for proof of such offence.
iii) It is also mentioned in section 377-A PPC that any other obscene act shall also 
be included in the definition of sexual abuse. The above definitions clearly reflects 
that they cannot be offences of same gravity but all of them entail minimum 
sentence of 14 years; therefore, do not cater to the requirement of sentencing for 
an offence in true sense. Thus, it can be termed as a bad piece of legislation, 
consequently a bad law, open to exploitation very easily. This type of legislation 
give rise to consideration that in fact, it may be said that all newly-made statutes 
are at first merely nominal law, and it requires a further process of growth, 
adaptation to the actual conditions of society, and confirmation by tacit consent of 
the members of the community, before they can attain the rank of essential law; 
however, instead of ripening gradually into essential law, such statutes are 
eliminated in the course of time by one of the three processes: repeal; 
obsolescence; and destructive interpretation by the courts.
iv) In criminal law, if a defendant commits a single act that simultaneously fulfills 
the definition of two separate offenses, merger will occur. This means that the 
lesser of the two offenses will drop out, and the accused will only be charged with 
the greater offense. This prevents double jeopardy problems from arising","i) Yes, the language, legislator applied to draft the offence of ‘Sexual abuse’

iii) Whether the protection accorded in Article 85(2) of the QSO to public record 
of private documents is applicable?
iv) What is the procedure to prove the execution of the registered document which 
is disputed?","i) Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (the “CPC”) confers even suo motu jurisdiction upon this Court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction vested in it. Revisional jurisdiction is discretionary, pre-eminently corrective and supervisory, therefore, there is absolutely no harm if the Court seized of a Revision Petition exercises its suo motu jurisdiction to examine and correct errors of jurisdiction committed by a subordinate Court or otherwise condones delay by exercising the discretion vested in the Court. ii) It was observed by the Apex Court that generally, an objection as to the mode of proof regarding a document, its contents or its execution is required to be taken, when a particular mode of proof is adopted at the stage of recording of evidence. In contrast, an objection as to the admissibility of a document can be raised at any stage of trial, appeal or revision even if it has not been taken when the document is tendered in evidence. iii) Article 85(5) of the QSO (Section 74(5) of the Evidence Act) expressly excludes registered documents, the execution of which is disputed and as such, the protection accorded in Article 85(2) of the QSO (Section 74(2) of the  Evidence Act) to public record of private documents was not applicable. iv) Once the execution of the registered First Sale Deed was disputed, it became a private document which was required to be produced and proved after complying with the requirements of Article 76 of the QSO (Section 65 of the Evidence Act). Moreover, the rebuttable presumption encapsulated in Article 100 of the QSO (Section 90 of the Evidence Act) mandates that the document must be produced from any custody which the Court in a particular case considers proper and in such an eventuality, the Court may presume that the signature and every other part of such document, which purports to be in the handwriting of any particular person, is in that person’s handwriting, and, in the case of a document executed or attested, that it was duly executed or attested by the persons by whom it purports to be executed and attested. Article 101 extends the provisions of Article 100 of the QSO (Sections 90-A & 90 of the Evidence Act) to certified documents which are not less than 30 years old stipulating that such certified copy may be produced in proof of the contents of the document which it purports to be a copy. The First Sale Deed was never produced through proper custody and even otherwise, the presumption was rebutted in an effective manner as stated aforesaid.","i) Section 115 of the CPC confers suo motu jurisdiction upon the Court in

ii) Whether while applying the schedule appended to Rules in SRO 
No.1138(I)/2014, the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion & Transfer) Rules,

proficiency which is gained after achieving the specific degree/education in order 
to meet the qualifying standards for the selected vacancy or job with the 
characteristics and attributes of ability, suitability and fitness of a person to 
perform a particular job or task with excellence. In fact it depends on the fine 
sense of judgment of requisitioning authority to structure the yardstick of required 
qualification for the post and no relaxation can be claimed in the criteria fixed for 
the post qualification experience.
ii) The learned High Court discarded the condition of post experience 
qualification as mentioned in Rule 12 of the APT Rules, 1973 as well as the 
advertisement published for inviting applications mainly on the ground that in 
SRO No.1138(I)/2014, no such condition was mentioned in the schedule for post 
qualification experience which was not correct advertence and appreciation to the 
applicable rules, on the contrary, it is clearly manifesting while appreciating the 
relevant rules in entirety or in conjunction… It was further held by the learned 
High Court that the proviso to Rule 12 will only come in field where the method 
of appointment does not provide the qualification and other conditions and since 
in the year 2014 the Rules were promulgated but through the aforesaid SRO with 
specific qualification and experience, hence the proviso attached to the schedule 
of the APT Rules, 1973 will not be applicable. In fact, the learned High Court

petitioner was dismissed","i) What does term sister concern means?
ii) When a company is deemed to be a subsidiary of another company?
iii) When the corporate veil of a company can be lifted?
iv) What is presumptive tax regime?
v) What is scope of jurisdiction of High court u/s 47 of Sales Tax Act, 1990?","i) There is no definition of “sister concern” either in the repealed Companies 
Ordinance, 1984 or the present Companies Act, 2017, but this turn of phrase 
basically delineates two or more distinct businesses or ventures owned by one and 
the same conglomerate but such undertakings/concerns do not have any link or 
nexus with the operations of each other’s business with the exception of conjoint 
ownership but legally or financially are not related to each other despite its 
affiliation with another company with a separate identity and workforces.
ii) A company is deemed to be a subsidiary of another, the holding company, if 
the latter holds a majority of its voting rights; is a member of it and has the right 
to appoint or remove a majority of board of directors; or is a member of it and 
controls alone (under an agreement with other members) a majority of its voting 
rights. A company is also deemed to be a subsidiary of another if it qualifies as a 
subsidiary of a subsidiary of the holding company. A ""wholly-owned subsidiary"" 
is one whose shares are exclusively owned by a holding company, its wholly 
owned subsidiaries and the nominees of either.
iii) It is true that occasionally the corporate veil of a company is pierced through 
in order to find out the substance but that is only where it is permitted by a statute 
or in exceptional cases of fraud. It is well-settled that, in a suitable case, the court 
can lift the corporate veil where the companies share the relationship of a holding

company and a subsidiary company and also to pay regard to the economic 
realities behind the legal facade. The modern tendency is where there is identity 
and community of interest between companies in the group, especially where they 
are related as holding company and wholly owned subsidiary or subsidiaries, to 
ignore their separate legal entity and look instead at the economic entity of the 
whole group tearing of the corporate veil.
iv) The presumptive tax regime in fact denotes that the tax so deducted or paid is 
treated as a final discharge of tax liability whereas the production capacity is 
reckoned by the Department according to the notified and applicable sales tax 
rates visà-vis the production as per comparative past and present physical 
production data including the machine ratings. Presumptive tax regime 
predominantly encompasses the usage of indirect means to determine tax liability, 
which diverges from the normal rules founded on the taxpayer's accounts to 
indicate a legal presumption that the tax liability is not less than the amount 
occasioning from the application of the indirect method. 
v) Prior to the amendment made through Finance Act 2005, (assented on 
29.6.2005), a right of appeal was provided which was later amended to a remedy 
of filing Reference. In both the scenario, the jurisdiction of High Court was and is 
strictly confined to answering questions of law which is evident from plain 
reading of original and amended Section 47 of the Sales Tax Act 1990 and 
obviously, the source of question must be the order of the Tribunal. The 
elementary characteristic of this jurisdiction is that it has been conferred to deal 
only with questions of law and not questions of fact. When we talk of a question 
of law, it connotes a tangible and substantial question of law on the rights and 
obligations of the parties founded on the decision of the Tribunal.","i) Term sister concern delineates two or more distinct businesses or ventures owned by one and the same conglomerate but such undertakings/concerns do not have any link or nexus with the operations of each other’s business with the exception of conjoint ownership but legally or financially are not related to each other despite its affiliation with another company with a separate identity and workforces. ii) A company is deemed to be a subsidiary of another, the holding company, if the latter holds a majority of its voting rights; is a member of it and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of board of directors; or is a member of it and controls alone (under an agreement with other members) a majority of its voting rights. iii) In a suitable case, the court can lift the corporate veil where the companies share the relationship of a holding company and a subsidiary company and also to pay regard to the economic realities behind the legal facade. iv) The presumptive tax regime in fact denotes that the tax so deducted or paid is treated as a final discharge of tax liability whereas the production capacity is reckoned by the Department according to the notified and applicable sales tax rates visà-vis the production as per comparative past and present physical FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN 4 production data including the machine ratings. v) The elementary characteristic of High court u/s 47 of Sales Tax Act, 1990 is that it has been conferred to deal only with questions of law and not questions of fact","Mr. Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Mr. Justice Yahya Afridi, Mr. Justice Muhammad

inanimate objects and institutions, including all courts?
ii) Whether Judges may be referred to as honourable (or the abbreviated hon’ble) 
or learned?","i) The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (‘the Constitution’) refers 
to this Court as the Supreme Court and to the High Courts as High Courts. The 
Constitution also does not use any prefix or honorific before these courts nor uses 
the terms August or Apex for the Supreme Court. It serves us best when we use 
the language of the Constitution with regard to institutions mentioned therein. 
Those whose vocation requires proper use of language should strive for accuracy, 
and for advocates and judges the preference should be to use the language of the 
Constitution. In the birthplace of the English language, the Supreme Court and 
High Courts are neither referred to as honourable or learned. The British 
Parliament, which is referred to as the mother of parliaments, is also not referred 
to as honourable. However, members of the British Parliament are referred to as 
Right Honourable. Usage of the honorific ‘honourable’ with inanimate 
institutions, like courts, is linguistically inappropriate. Therefore, our 
understanding that honourable (or honorable) is not to be used as an honorific or 
prefix with inanimate objects and institutions, including all courts, stands 
confirmed.
ii) Judges may be referred to as honourable (or the abbreviated hon’ble) or 
learned. Any use of language that is respectful and concise is sufficient. However,

State Life Insurance Corporation & another v. Mst. Razia Ameer & another,1.17,Insurance Law,Supreme Court of Pakistan,"This direct appeal is of the insurer and challenges the cogency of the judgment of 
the first Appellate Court, which is at variance with the judgment of the Insurance 
Tribunal","Whether the legal heirs of the assured person are entitled to claim liquidated 
damages under Section 118 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000?","The legal heirs of the assured person are entitled to claim liquidated damages 
under Section 118 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000. 
","The Insurance Tribunal, Punjab, declined to grant liquidated damages mainly on 
two grounds. The first was that the revised contract entered into between the 
insurer and the Provincial Welfare Board, Punjab did not contain a clause for 
liquidated damages. It appears that the Insurance Tribunal, Punjab, while 
returning this finding did not consider Section 118 of the Insurance Ordinance, 
2000, which provides that payment of liquidated damages on late settlement of 
claims shall be an implied term of every contract of insurance. This omission was 
noted by the first Appellate Court and thus, held that on completion of all 
formalities, if the claim is not satisfied/cleared within ninety days without any 
fault of the claimant when it becomes due, then, under the implied term of every 
contract of insurance the liquidated damages must be granted. We are of the view 
that the findings of the first Appellate Court does not suffer from any legal 
infirmity and are accordingly sustained. The other reason which dissuaded the 
Insurance Tribunal to grant the application filed by respondent No.1 under 
Section 122 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000 was that since the assured person 
was not a party to the group insurance contract, his legal heirs had no standing to 
claim liquidated damages. This understanding was inconsistent with the scheme 
of group insurance and the provision of law applicable thereto, and thus, the first 
Appellate Court rightly repelled it with the observation that group insurance is 
designed to provide monetary benefits to the family of the assured person; 
particularly, if the assured person has not defaulted in payment of premium 
amount.

on the subject of recording adverse remarks in PERs. According to relevant 
instructions, as a general rule, an officer is to be apprised, if his Reporting or 
Countersigning Officer is dissatisfied with his work, and the communication of 
such dissatisfaction with advice or warning should be prompt so that the officer 
may eradicate the fault and improve his performance. That is why it is emphasised 
that the Reporting or Countersigning Officers should not ordinarily record adverse 
remarks as to the performance of an officer without prior counselling. They are 
thus expected to apprise the officer concerned about his weak points and advise 
him how to improve, and to record the adverse remarks in the PER when the 
officer fails to improve despite counselling. The supervisory officers under whose 
supervision other officers work must realise that the supervision does not mean 
cracking the whip on finding a fault in their performance, rather the primary 
purpose of the supervision is to guide the subordinate officers in improving their 
performance and efficiency, and that their role is more like a mentor rather than a 
punishing authority. As the purpose of counselling is to improve the performance 
of the officer and not to insult or intimidate him, the supervisory officers are also 
to see, having regard to the temperament of the officer concerned, whether the 
advice or warning given orally or in written form, or given publicly in a general 
meeting of the officers or privately in a separate meeting with the concerned 
FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN
officer only, would be beneficial for the officer in improving his performance. 
The directions contained in the instructions, in this regard, on paying great 
attention to the manner and method of communicating advice or warning should 
be adhered to. It must also be pointed out that such guidance, through counselling, 
for improving the performance and efficiency of a subordinate officer, can 
ultimately benefit the organization as it enables identifying and addressing 
performance issues before they become major problems, thereby, leading to 
increased productivity and better performance so that the organization’s goals and 
objectives are effectively achieved","First, the Countersigning officer must give reasons for his disagreement with the 
evaluation of the Reporting officer and secondly, he must do counselling of the 
officer by pointing out his shortcomings and advising him how to improve them. 
If the officer fails to improve despite counselling, then he may record adverse 
remarks in his PER","Mr. Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Mr. Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail,

A witness may be called ""interested"" only when he or she derives some benefit in seeing an accused person punished. A witness who is a natural one and is the only possible eyewitness in the circumstances of a case cannot be said to be ""interested""."" In the present case, FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN  the eye witnesses, one of whom was an injured eye-witness have spoken consistently and cogently in describing the manner of commission of the crime in detail. The testimony of an injured eyewitness carries more evidentiary value. The Court is not persuaded that their evidence is to be discarded merely because they happen to be related witnesses. iii) The medical evidence available on the record further corroborates the ocular account so far as the nature, time, locale and impact of the injuries on the person of the deceased and injured is concerned. Even otherwise, it is settled law that where ocular evidence is found trustworthy and confidence inspiring, the same is given preference over medical evidence and the same alone is sufficient to sustain conviction of an accused. iv) It is settled principle of law that the value and status of medical evidence and recovery is always corroborative in its nature, which alone is not sufficient to sustain the conviction. Minor discrepancies and conflicts appearing in medical evidence and the ocular version are quite possible for variety of reasons. During occurrence witnesses in a momentary glance make only tentative assessment of the distance between the deceased and the assailant and the points where accused caused injuries. It becomes highly improbable to correctly mention the number and location of the injuries with exactitude. Minor discrepancies, if any, in medical evidence relating to nature of injuries do not negate the direct evidence. v) We may point out that ‘discrepancy’ has to be distinguished from ‘contradiction’. Contradiction in the statement of the witness is fatal for the prosecution case whereas minor discrepancy or variance in evidence will not make the prosecution case doubtful. It is normal course of the human conduct that while narrating a particular incident there may occur minor discrepancies. Parrot like statements are always discredited by the courts. In order to ascertain as to whether the discrepancy pointed out was minor or not or the same amounts to contradiction, regard is required to be made to the circumstances of the case by keeping in view the social status of the witnesses and environment in which such witnesses were making the statement. There are always normal discrepancies, howsoever, honest and truthful a witness may be. Such discrepancies are due to normal errors of observation, memory due to lapse of time and mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence. Material discrepancies are those which are not normal and not expected of a normal person.","i) Promptness of FIR shows truthfulness of the prosecution case and it excludes

said amount without interest and executed the decree. Petitioner filed an FAO 
against the order of the civil court, which was dismissed by the Islamabad High 
Court against which the instant petition has been filed by the petitioner","i) What are the grounds for challenging the arbitration award?
ii) What is scope of judicial review of award announced by arbitrators?
iii) What does misconduct of arbitrators means?","i) The grounds for challenging an Award are very limited. There are three broad 
areas on which an arbitration Award is likely to be challenged i.e. firstly, 
jurisdictional grounds (non-existence of a valid and binding arbitration 
agreement); secondly, procedural grounds (failure to observe principles of natural 
justice) and thirdly, substantive grounds (arbitrator made a mistake of law).
ii) There is a limited scope of judicial review of the ‘Award’ announced by an 
Arbitrator. An arbitration Award is a final determination of the dispute between 
the parties. The review of an arbitration Award cannot constitute a re-assessment 
or reappraisal of the evidence by the court. An over-intrusive approach by courts 
in examination of the arbitral Awards must be avoided. The court is not supposed 
to sit as a court of appeal and must confine itself to the patent illegalities in the 
Award, if any. The jurisdiction of the Court under the Act is supervisory in 
nature. Interference is only possible if there exists any breach of duty or any 
irregularity of action which is not consistent with general principles of equity and 
good conscience. The arbitrator alone is the judge of the quality as well as the 
quantity of the evidence. He is the final arbiter of dispute between the parties. He 
acts in a quasi-judicial manner and his decision is entitled to utmost respect and 
weight. By applying the afore-noted principles of law on the subject and 
considering the petitioner’s objections within the limited scope of court’s 
jurisdiction in testing the validity of Award this court is not supposed to sit as a 
court of appeal and make a roving inquiry and look for latent errors of law and 
facts in the Award. The arbitration is a forum of the parties' own choice its 
decision should not be lightly interfered by the court, until a clear and definite 
case within the purview of the section 30 of the Act is made out.

his essential duty or any conduct inconsistent with his duties, resulting in 
substantial miscarriage of justice between the parties","i) There are three broad areas on which an arbitration Award is likely to be

v) Whether the requirement of corroborative evidence is rule of law?
vi) What is the requirement to be considered by the court while appreciating the 
evidence of a witness?","i) This Court in a number of judgments has held that testimony of police officials is as good as any other private witness unless it is proved that they have animus against the accused. This Court has time and again held that reluctance of general public to become witness in such like cases has become judicially recognized fact and there is no way out to consider statement of official witnesses, as no legal bar or restriction has been imposed in such regard. Police officials are as good witnesses and could be relied upon, if their testimonies remain un-shattered during cross-examination. ii) Process of identification parade has to be essentially carried out having regard to the exigencies of each case in a fair and non-collusive manner and such exercise is not an immutable ritual, inconsequential non-performance whereof, FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN  may cause failure of prosecution case, which otherwise is structured upon clean and probable evidence. Reliance is placed on Tasar Mehmood Vs. The State (2020 SCMR 1013). iii) It is settled law that where ocular evidence is found trustworthy and confidence inspiring, the same is given preference over medical evidence and the same alone is sufficient to sustain conviction of an accused. Reliance is placed on Muhammad Iqbal Vs. The State (1996 SCMR 908), Naeem Akhtar Vs. The State (PLD 2003 SC 396), Faisal Mehmood Vs. The State (2010 SCMR 1025) and Muhammad Ilyas Vs. The State (2011 SCMR 460). iv) It is settled principle of law that the value and status of medical evidence and recovery is always corroborative in its nature, which alone is not sufficient to sustain the conviction. Casual discrepancies and conflicts appearing in medical evidence and the ocular version are quite possible for variety of reasons. Minor discrepancies, if any, in medical evidence relating to nature of injuries do not negate the direct evidence as witnesses are not supposed to give photo picture of ocular account. Even otherwise, conflict of ocular account with medical evidence being not material imprinting any dent in prosecution version would have no adverse effect on prosecution case. v) Requirement of corroborative evidence is not of much significance and same is not a rule of law but is that of prudence. vi) It is a well settled proposition of law that as long as the material aspects of the evidence have a ring of truth, courts should ignore minor discrepancies in the evidence. The test is whether the evidence of a witness inspires confidence. If an omission or discrepancy goes to the root of the matter, the defence can take advantage of the same. While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the evidence read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not affecting the material considerations of the prosecution case ought not to prompt the courts to reject evidence in its entirety. Such minor discrepancies which do not shake the salient features of the prosecution case should be ignored","i) Police officials are as good witnesses as private witnesess and could be relied 
upon, if their testimonies remain un-shattered during cross-examination.

to the exigencies of each case in a fair and non-collusive manner.

this petition.","i) Whether a contract for sale of immovable property itself, create any interest in

x) In case of inconsistency between the Trial Court and the Appellate Court, the 
findings of which court can be given preference in the absence of any cogent 
reason to the contrary?","i) According to Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act 1882, “sale” means the 
transfer of ownership in exchange for a price paid or promised or part paid and 
part promised which is made in the case of tangible immovable property of the 
value of one hundred rupees and upwards or in the case of a reversion or other 
intangible thing, can be made only by a registered instrument with further rider 
that a contract for the sale of immovable property is a contract that a sale of such 
property shall take place on terms settled between the parties but it does not, of 
FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN
15
itself, create any interest in or charge on such property.
ii) Whereas under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act 1877, a person entitled to 
any legal character or to right as to any property, may institute a suit against any 
person denying, or interested to deny, his title to such character or right and the 
Court may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is so entitled, and 
the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any further relief, but according to the 
attached proviso, no Court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, 
being able to seek further relief than mere declaration of title, omits to do so. The 
expression “legal character” has been understood to be synonymous with the 
expression status. A suit for mere declaration is not permissible except in the 
circumstances mentioned in Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. The claim of 
mere declaration as to alleged title does not suffice.
iii) On the basis of a sale agreement, no legal character or right can be established 
to prove the title of the property unless the title is transferred pursuant to such 
agreement to sell, but in case of denial or refusal by the vendor to specifically 
perform the agreement despite the readiness and willingness of the vendee, a suit 
for specific performance may be instituted in the court, but suit for declaration on 
the basis of a mere sale agreement is not the solution for appropriate relief.
iv) Under Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act, the exercise of jurisdiction by the 
Court for decreeing the suit for specific performance of contract is discretionary 
in nature in which the Court is not bound to grant such relief, but in tandem the 
discretion is not to be exercised arbitrarily but should be based on sound legal 
principles after analyzing and gauging the circumstances, inter alia, whether the
contract is such which gives an unfair advantage to the plaintiff over the 
defendant or the performance of the contract encompasses some hardship on the 
defendant which he could not foresee or whether its non-performance would 
embroil some hardship to the plaintiff and whether the plaintiff has done 
substantial acts or suffered losses in consequence of a contract capable of specific 
performance. The person seeking specific performance has to establish that he is 
enthusiastic and vehement to act upon his obligations as per the contract but the 
opponent is refusing or delaying its execution.
v) Obviously, the first part of Article 113 of the Limitation Act refers to the 
exactitudes of its application when time is of the essence of the contract, which 
means an exact timeline was fixed for the performance of obligations arising out 
of the contract/agreement hence, in this particular situation, the limitation period 
or starting point of limitation will be reckoned from that date and not from date of 
refusal, however, if no specific date was fixed for performance of agreement and 
time was not of the essence, then the right to sue will accrue from the date of
knowledge about refusal by the executant.
vi) It was further held that the proposition that where an agreement to sell 
pertaining to immovable property is not signed by one of the parties thereto is, in 
each and every eventuality, invalid and not specifically enforceable is fallacious 
and contrary to the law. The existence and validity of the agreement and it being 
specifically enforceable or otherwise would depend upon the proof of its 
FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN
16
existence, validity and enforceability in accordance with the Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984, the relevant provisions of the Contract Act, 1872, the Specific Relief 
Act, 1877, and any other law applicable thereto.
vii) In the aforesaid perspective, the doctrine of prospective overruling is also 
quite relevant which originated in the American Judicial System. The literal 
meaning of the term 'overruling' is to overturn or set aside a precedent by 
expressly deciding that it should no longer be a controlling law. Similarly 
'prospective' means operative or effective in the future. According to the dictum 
laid down in the case of Pakistan Medical and Dental Council & others vs. 
Muhammad Fahad Malik & others (2018 SCMR 1956) the judgments of this 
Court (Supreme Court) unless declared otherwise operate prospectively. More or 
less, similar findings that the law laid down by this Court is prospective which 
cannot be doubted have been recorded in the case of Sakhi Muhammad and 
another vs. Capital Development Authority, Islamabad (PLD 1991 S.C 777) and 
Pir Bakhsh and others vs. The Chairman, Allotment Committee and others, (PLD 
1987 S.C. 145).
viii) No doubt to constitute a valid contract one of the conditions is “consensus ad 
idem” which must exist with regard to the terms and conditions of the contract 
and, in case of any ambiguity, it may adversely reflect on its very existence. In 
fact it is a Latin term in the law of contract that means the existence of meeting of 
minds of all parties involved which is the elementary constituent for the 
enforcement and execution of a contract and in case of no consensus ad idem 
there shall be no binding contract and in case of any palpable inexactitude or 
obliviousness in the settled terms and conditions then there shall be no probability 
to get a hold of any outcome of such defective agreement.
ix) Where an effective and enforceable contract is not structured by the parties, it 
is not the domain or province of the Court to make out a contract for them but the 
lis would be decided on the basis of terms and conditions agreed and settled down 
in the contract. The decree for specific performance may not be passed if the 
substratum of the contract suffers from shortcoming or legal infirmities which 
render the contract unacceptable and unenforceable.
x) In the case of Amjad Ikram vs. Mst. Asiya Kausar (2015 SCMR 1), the court 
held that in case of inconsistency between the Trial Court and the Appellate 
Court, the findings of the latter must be given preference in the absence of any 
cogent reason to the contrary as has been held by this court in the judgments 
reported, as Madan Gopal and 4 others v. Maran Bepari and 3 others (PLD 1969 
SC 617) & Muhammad Nawaz through LRs. v. Haji Muhammad Baran Khan 
through LRs. and others (2013 SCMR 1300).",": i) A contract for sale of immovable property can take place on terms settled 
between the parties but it does not itself, create any interest in or charge on such 
property.
ii) Court cannot make any declaration where the party, being able to seek further 
relief than mere declaration of title, omits to do so

(ii) When does the right of a person to sue for declaration of right of inheritance in

(iv) Whether mere omission by brothers to pay a share of the profits or produce of 
the joint property to their sisters amounts to actual denial of rights of the sisters?
(v) Whether a fraudulent sale, gift or mutation of shares of sisters in joint property 
by brothers amounts to actual denial of rights of sisters hence giving rise to 
compulsory cause of action? 
(vi) When would limitation starts to run in case sisters are deprived of their shares 
in joint property through fraud by brothers?
(vii) Whether the benefit of section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1908 is available 
against any person who is a transferee in good faith and for valuable 
consideration?","(i) In view of the provisions of the residuary Article 120 of Schedule-I to the 
Limitation Act 1908, there can hardly be any suit to which the bar of limitation 
does not apply. As per the said Article a suit for which no period of limitation is 
provided elsewhere in the Schedule, the period of limitation for that suit is six 
years from the time when the right to sue accrues. No specific Article of 
Schedule-I to the Limitation Act provides a period of limitation for a suit 
instituted by a person, under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act 1877, for 
declaration of his ownership rights to any property against a person denying his 
said rights; therefore, the residuary Article 120 applies to such suit. A suit 
instituted by a female legal heir for declaration of her ownership rights as to the 
property left by her deceased father in his inheritance, against her brother who 
denies her rights is thus governed by the provisions of Article 120. To decide 
whether such a suit is barred by limitation, the six-year period of limitation 
provided by Article 120 is to be counted from the time when the right to sue for 
declaration accrues as provided therein. 
(ii) The question, when the right to sue for declaration has accrued in a case, 
depends upon the facts and circumstances of that case, as it accrues when the 
FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN
2
defendant denies (actually) or is interested to deny (threatens) the rights of the 
plaintiff as per Section 42 of the Specific relief Act 1877. The actual denial of 
rights gives rise to a compulsory cause of action and obligates the plaintiff to 
institute the suit for declaration of his rights, if he wants to do so, within the 
prescribed period of limitation; while in case of a threatened denial of rights, it is 
the option of the plaintiff to institute such a suit on a particular threat. On the 
actual denial of rights, the cause of action and the consequent right to sue matures 
for instituting the suit for declaration; whereas every threatened denial of rights 
gives rise to a fresh cause of action, and thus a fresh right to sue accrues on such a 
denial.
(iii) Because of the special characteristics of their relationship, the criterion for 
determining the actual denial of a co-sharer’s rights as to joint property by the 
other co-sharer is different from the one that is applied between strangers. Co sharers have a relationship of trust and support for each other. Possession of joint 
property with one co-sharer is considered to be for and on behalf of all the co sharers. A co-sharer who is not in actual possession is considered to be in 
constructive possession of the joint property. Each co-sharer protects the joint 
property against trespassers for the benefit of all the co-sharers. Even if one co sharer acquires possession of some portion of the joint property in consequence of 
legal proceedings initiated by him against a trespasser, he is deemed to be in 
possession of that portion of the joint property, on behalf of all the co-sharers. 
Against this backdrop, the actual denial of a co-sharer’s rights as to joint property 
by the other co-sharer is not to be readily inferred. Actual denial of a co-sharer’s 
rights by the other co-sharer may occur when the latter does something explicit 
in denial of the former’s rights. A mere oral negation, even made several times, of 
each other’s rights by the co-sharers on different disputes as to the use and sharing 
of the profits of the joint property, but without doing any overt act to oust a co sharer from the ownership of the joint property, cannot be treated as an actual 
denial of the rights and thus does not necessitate to sue for declaration of 
ownership rights. 
(iv) Mere omission to pay a share of the profits or produce of the joint property to 
their sisters by the brothers in possession of the joint property does not in itself 
constitute a repudiation of the sisters’ rights, nor does a wrong entry as to the 
inheritance rights in the revenue record oust the sisters from their ownership of 
the joint property as the devolution of the ownership of the property on legal 
heirs of a person takes place under the Islamic law of inheritance immediately on 
the death of that person without any intervention of anyone and without the 
sanction of the inheritance mutation in the revenue record.
(v) The position is, however, different when the brothers in possession of the 
joint property make a fraudulent sale or gift deed or get sanctioned some 
mutation, whether of sale or gift etc., in the revenue record claiming that their 
sisters have transferred their share in the joint property to them, or when they on 
the basis of a wrong inheritance mutation start selling out or otherwise disposing 
of the joint property claiming them to be the exclusive owners thereof. In such 
FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN
3
circumstances, the brothers by their overt act expressly repudiate the rights of 
their sisters in the joint property, and oust them from the ownership of the joint 
property. Their acts are, therefore, a clear and actual denial of the rights of the 
sisters, which give rise to a compulsory cause of action and obligates the sisters to 
institute the suit for declaration of their rights, if they want to do so, within the 
prescribed period of limitation. 
(vi) Although, by the said acts of the brothers, the right accrues to the sisters to 
sue for declaration of their rights, but if they by means of fraud are kept from the 
knowledge of those overt acts, the time limit of six years provided in Article 
120 for instituting the suit for declaration against brothers or any person claiming 
through them otherwise than in good faith and for a valuable consideration, is to 
be computed from the time when the fraud of the brothers first became known to 
the sisters, by virtue of the provisions of Section 18 of the Limitation Act. 
The “fraud” contemplated by Section 18 means suppression of those acts or 
transactions that give rise to the cause of action from coming into the knowledge 
of the plaintiff. A deliberate concealment of facts intended to prevent discovery of 
the right to sue is also a “fraud” within the meaning of the term used in this 
Section, but an open act of a party cannot be said to be a fraudulent act of 
concealment and is therefore not covered by this Section.
(vii) The benefit of Section 18 is, however, not available against any person who 
though claims through the defrauding party but is a transferee in good faith and 
for a valuable consideration. That is why this Court has treated differently the two 
types of cases: (i) where the joint property is still in possession of the defrauding 
brothers or their legal heirs; and (ii) where the joint property has been alienated 
further to third persons- the transferees in good faith and for a valuable 
consideration","(i) Limitation does apply where a person seeks to enforce his right of inheritance 
in the estate of his deceased predecessor.
(ii) The right of a person to sue for declaration of right of inheritance in the estate 
of his deceased predecessor accrues when the defendant denies (actually) or is 
interested to deny (threatens) such rights of the plaintiff.
(iii) The criterion for determination of actual denial of right as to joint property is 
different in cases of co-sharers as compared to strangers. 
(iv) Mere omission by brothers to pay a share of the profits or produce of the joint 
property to their sisters does not amount to actual denial of rights of the sisters.
(v) A fraudulent sale, gift or mutation of shares of sisters in joint property by

compulsory cause of action.
(vi) In case sisters are deprived of their shares in joint property through fraud by

iii) Whether the competent authority has power or jurisdiction to approve, remand 
or reject the recommendations of CSB or DPC?","i) The concept of promotion is provided under Section 9 of the Civil Servants Act, 
1973, which prescribes that a civil servant possessing such minimum 
qualifications as may be prescribed shall be eligible for promotion to a higher 
post. In Sub-Section (3), it is clearly provided that promotions to the posts in 
BPS-20 and BPS-21 and equivalent shall be made on the recommendations of the 
Selection Board, which shall be headed by the Chairman, Federal Public Service 
Commission. According to Sub-Clause (b) of Rule 2 of the Civil Servants 
(Appointment, Promotion & Transfer) Rules, 1973, (APT Rules, 1973) Central 
Selection Board (CSB) means a Board constituted by the Federal Government for 
the purposes of selection for promotion or transfer to a post in BPS-18 in the
District Management Group, Police Group and posts in BPS-19 to 21 and 
equivalent, consisting of such persons, as may be appointed by the Federal 
Government from time to time. It is further provided in Rule 7 of the APT Rules,

shall be made on the recommendations of appropriate Departmental Promotion 
Committee (“DPC”) and promotions and transfers to posts in BPS-19 to BPS-21 
and equivalent shall be made on the recommendation of the Selection Board. At 
this juncture, Rule 7 (a) is also very significant, which explicates that the 
competent authority may approve the promotion of an officer or official from the 
date on which the recommendation of Central Selection Board or as the case may 
be, the Departmental Promotion Committee was made. According to Rule 7 of the 
APT Rules, 1973, the competent authority may approve the promotion of an

bound to accept the recommendations of CSB or DPC.
ii) It is further provided in Sub-Rule (2) that notwithstanding anything in FR-17, 
the officer or official, who expires or superannuates after the recommendations of 
CSB or DPC and before issuing of the notification, shall stand exempted from 
assumption of the charge of the higher post. The principal appointing officer or an 
officer so authorized will give a certificate to the effect that the officer or official 
has expired or superannuated. Moreover, Rule 8 further expounds that only such 
person as possesses the qualification and meet the conditions laid down for the 
purpose of promotion or transfer to a post, shall be considered by the DPC or the 
Selection Board, as the case may be.
iii) It is lucidly provided under Rule 5 of the Civil Servants Promotion (BPS-18 to 
BPS 21) Rules, 2019 that the recommendation made by the Central Section 
Board, Departmental Selection Board or Departmental Promotion Committee 
shall have no effect unless approved by the appointing authority concerned with 
further condition specifically in sub-rule 3 that appointing authority shall have 
powers to approve or reject or remand back the recommendations of the Central 
Section Board, Departmental Selection Board or Departmental Promotion 
Committee, whereas in sub-rule (4) it is further provided that in case of rejection 
or remanding back any recommendation, the competent authority shall record 
reasons for doing so. ","i) According to Rule 7 of the APT Rules, 1973 the competent authority is not 
bound to approve the promotion of an officer or official from the date on which

iii) Whether institutions which are funded by the public can be referred to as state

Justice (or to the Registrar) the power to make special benches?
(v)Whether the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 provide how to attend Suo Motu 
cases?
(vi) Whether collective determination by the Chief Justice and the Judges of the 
Supreme Court can be assumed by only the Chief Justice?","i) The Judiciary would be flawed if it is not open to constructive criticism. The 
Judiciary exists to serve the people and should embrace observations, opinions, 
and critique as it also serves as a check on its own functioning. The people's 
feedback also helps identify shortcomings, which can thereafter be addressed. 
Constructive criticism serves the interest of the Judiciary as it helps improve its 
performance. The relationship between the litigant, who is the service-user, and 
the Judiciary, which is the service-provider, should be collaborative, with the 
common goal of improving the service. Forbidding criticism neither serves the 
interest of the people nor of the Judiciary. Islam does not prohibit the criticism of 
Judges. Believers must speak the truth. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings 
FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN
7
be upon him) taught that the highest form of jihad (struggle) is to speak up against 
an oppressor, and if despite seeing wrongdoing people do nothing, then they too 
will be punished. Judges adjudicate, and at times hold others to account. 
Therefore, it would be constitutionally, legally, morally, and religiously 
indefensible to absolve Judges from accountability. Prescribing something for 
others but not abiding by it oneself is most offensive to Almighty Allah and He 
castigates hypocrites. PEMRA's complete prohibition to criticize Judges offends 
the Constitution, law, morality, and Islam.
ii) The Chairman of PEMRA, alone, does not constitute PEMRA. The law which 
established and governs PEMRA states that, 'All orders, determinations and 
decisions of the Authority [PEMRA] shall be taken in writing and shall identify 
the determination of the Chairman and each member separatel y.' PEMRA 
comprises of the 'Chairman and twelve members'. However, the Prohibition Order 
does not disclose if the members had any say in the matter, let alone whether a 
meeting of the members took place, how many attended it and their 
determinations. This lack of disclosure by a statutory-regulatory body is of 
concern.
iii) State institutions are neither mentioned in the Constitution nor in PEMRA's 
law. Institutions which are funded by the public may be referred to as public 
institutions, acknowledging the public's ownership, and that they serve the public. 
When the phrase public institution is substituted with state institution, it is not 
inconsequential phraseology; as the public's ownership of the institution is 
severed and renders it unaccountable.
iv) Neither the Constitution nor the Rules grant to the Chief Justice (or to the 
Registrar) the power to make special benches, select Judges who will be on these 
benches and decide the cases which they will hear. There is also no additional, 
incidental, ancillary, or residual power with the Chief Justice which could be 
used to do this. Yet, unfortunately, this is being done, and sometimes with grave 
repercussions. When benches are tailored and Judges of a particular 
understanding or inclination are placed together to hear a particular case, then 
doubts, suspicion, and misgivings arise. A decision from an adjudicatory process, 
which is perceived to be structured to obtain a particular decision, invariably 
results in severe criticism. The matter assumes criticality when objections taken 
on the constitution of Special Benches, and requests made for hearing by the Full 
Court, are not attended to, and no order disposing of such objections and requests 
is passed.
v) With regard to article 184(3) of the Constitution there are three categories of 
cases. Firstly, when a formal application seeking enforcement of Fundamental 
Rights is filed. Secondly, when (suo mot-u) notice is taken by the Supreme Court 
or its Judges. And, thirdly cases of immense constitutional importance and 
significance (which may also be those in the first and second category). Order 
XXV of the Rules only attends to the first category of cases. There is no 
procedure prescribed for the second and third category of cases. The situation is 
exacerbated as there is no appeal against a decision under Article 184(3) of the 
Constitution. The Rules also do not provide how to attend to the following 
matters: (a) how such cases be listed for hearing, (b) how bench/benches to hear 
such cases be constituted and (c) how Judges hearing them are selected.
vi) The Supreme Court is empowered to make makes rules attending to the 
aforesaid matters. The Supreme Court comprises of the Chief Justice and all 
Judges."" The Constitution does not grant to the Chief Justice unilateral and 
arbitrary power to decide the above matters. With respect, the Chief Justice 
cannot substitute his personal wisdom with that of the Constitution, Collective 
determination by the Chief Justice and the Judges of the Supreme Court can also 
not be assumed by an individual, albeit the Chief Justice","i) PEMRA's complete prohibition to criticize judges offends the constitution, law,

ii) Whether while applying the schedule appended to Rules in SRO 
No.1138(I)/2014, the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion & Transfer) Rules,

proficiency which is gained after achieving the specific degree/education in order 
to meet the qualifying standards for the selected vacancy or job with the 
characteristics and attributes of ability, suitability and fitness of a person to 
perform a particular job or task with excellence. In fact it depends on the fine 
sense of judgment of requisitioning authority to structure the yardstick of required 
qualification for the post and no relaxation can be claimed in the criteria fixed for 
the post qualification experience.
ii) The learned High Court discarded the condition of post experience 
qualification as mentioned in Rule 12 of the APT Rules, 1973 as well as the 
advertisement published for inviting applications mainly on the ground that in 
SRO No.1138(I)/2014, no such condition was mentioned in the schedule for post 
qualification experience which was not correct advertence and appreciation to the

High Court that the proviso to Rule 12 will only come in field where the method 
of appointment does not provide the qualification and other conditions and since 
in the year 2014 the Rules were promulgated but through the aforesaid SRO with 
specific qualification and experience, hence the proviso attached to the schedule

iii) When the corporate veil of a company can be lifted?
iv) What is presumptive tax regime?
v) What is scope of jurisdiction of High court u/s 47 of Sales Tax Act, 1990?","i) There is no definition of “sister concern” either in the repealed Companies 
Ordinance, 1984 or the present Companies Act, 2017, but this turn of phrase 
basically delineates two or more distinct businesses or ventures owned by one and 
the same conglomerate but such undertakings/concerns do not have any link or 
nexus with the operations of each other’s business with the exception of conjoint 
ownership but legally or financially are not related to each other despite its 
affiliation with another company with a separate identity and workforces.
ii) A company is deemed to be a subsidiary of another, the holding company, if 
the latter holds a majority of its voting rights; is a member of it and has the right 
to appoint or remove a majority of board of directors; or is a member of it and 
controls alone (under an agreement with other members) a majority of its voting 
rights. A company is also deemed to be a subsidiary of another if it qualifies as a 
subsidiary of a subsidiary of the holding company. A ""wholly-owned subsidiary"" 
is one whose shares are exclusively owned by a holding company, its wholly 
owned subsidiaries and the nominees of either.
iii) It is true that occasionally the corporate veil of a company is pierced through 
in order to find out the substance but that is only where it is permitted by a statute 
or in exceptional cases of fraud. It is well-settled that, in a suitable case, the court 
can lift the corporate veil where the companies share the relationship of a holding

company and a subsidiary company and also to pay regard to the economic 
realities behind the legal facade. The modern tendency is where there is identity 
and community of interest between companies in the group, especially where they 
are related as holding company and wholly owned subsidiary or subsidiaries, to 
ignore their separate legal entity and look instead at the economic entity of the 
whole group tearing of the corporate veil.
iv) The presumptive tax regime in fact denotes that the tax so deducted or paid is 
treated as a final discharge of tax liability whereas the production capacity is 
reckoned by the Department according to the notified and applicable sales tax 
rates visà-vis the production as per comparative past and present physical 
production data including the machine ratings. Presumptive tax regime 
predominantly encompasses the usage of indirect means to determine tax liability, 
which diverges from the normal rules founded on the taxpayer's accounts to 
indicate a legal presumption that the tax liability is not less than the amount 
occasioning from the application of the indirect method. 
v) Prior to the amendment made through Finance Act 2005, (assented on 
29.6.2005), a right of appeal was provided which was later amended to a remedy 
of filing Reference. In both the scenario, the jurisdiction of High Court was and is 
strictly confined to answering questions of law which is evident from plain 
reading of original and amended Section 47 of the Sales Tax Act 1990 and 
obviously, the source of question must be the order of the Tribunal. The 
elementary characteristic of this jurisdiction is that it has been conferred to deal 
only with questions of law and not questions of fact. When we talk of a question 
of law, it connotes a tangible and substantial question of law on the rights and 
obligations of the parties founded on the decision of the Tribunal.","i) Term sister concern delineates two or more distinct businesses or ventures owned by one and the same conglomerate but such undertakings/concerns do not have any link or nexus with the operations of each other’s business with the exception of conjoint ownership but legally or financially are not related to each other despite its affiliation with another company with a separate identity and workforces. ii) A company is deemed to be a subsidiary of another, the holding company, if the latter holds a majority of its voting rights; is a member of it and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of board of directors; or is a member of it and controls alone (under an agreement with other members) a majority of its voting rights. iii) In a suitable case, the court can lift the corporate veil where the companies share the relationship of a holding company and a subsidiary company and also to pay regard to the economic realities behind the legal facade. iv) The presumptive tax regime in fact denotes that the tax so deducted or paid is treated as a final discharge of tax liability whereas the production capacity is reckoned by the Department according to the notified and applicable sales tax rates visà-vis the production as per comparative past and present physical FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN 4 production data including the machine ratings. v) The elementary characteristic of High court u/s 47 of Sales Tax Act, 1990 is that it has been conferred to deal only with questions of law and not questions of fact","Mr. Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Mr. Justice Yahya Afridi, Mr. Justice Muhammad

inanimate objects and institutions, including all courts?
ii) Whether Judges may be referred to as honourable (or the abbreviated hon’ble) 
or learned?","i) The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (‘the Constitution’) refers 
to this Court as the Supreme Court and to the High Courts as High Courts. The 
Constitution also does not use any prefix or honorific before these courts nor uses 
the terms August or Apex for the Supreme Court. It serves us best when we use 
the language of the Constitution with regard to institutions mentioned therein. 
Those whose vocation requires proper use of language should strive for accuracy, 
and for advocates and judges the preference should be to use the language of the 
Constitution. In the birthplace of the English language, the Supreme Court and 
High Courts are neither referred to as honourable or learned. The British 
Parliament, which is referred to as the mother of parliaments, is also not referred 
to as honourable. However, members of the British Parliament are referred to as 
Right Honourable. Usage of the honorific ‘honourable’ with inanimate 
institutions, like courts, is linguistically inappropriate. Therefore, our 
understanding that honourable (or honorable) is not to be used as an honorific or 
prefix with inanimate objects and institutions, including all courts, stands

State Life Insurance Corporation & another v. Mst. Razia Ameer & another,1.17,Insurance Law,Supreme Court of Pakistan,"This direct appeal is of the insurer and challenges the cogency of the judgment of 
the first Appellate Court, which is at variance with the judgment of the Insurance 
Tribunal","Whether the legal heirs of the assured person are entitled to claim liquidated 
damages under Section 118 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000?","The legal heirs of the assured person are entitled to claim liquidated damages 
under Section 118 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000. 
","The Insurance Tribunal, Punjab, declined to grant liquidated damages mainly on 
two grounds. The first was that the revised contract entered into between the 
insurer and the Provincial Welfare Board, Punjab did not contain a clause for 
liquidated damages. It appears that the Insurance Tribunal, Punjab, while 
returning this finding did not consider Section 118 of the Insurance Ordinance, 
2000, which provides that payment of liquidated damages on late settlement of 
claims shall be an implied term of every contract of insurance. This omission was 
noted by the first Appellate Court and thus, held that on completion of all 
formalities, if the claim is not satisfied/cleared within ninety days without any 
fault of the claimant when it becomes due, then, under the implied term of every 
contract of insurance the liquidated damages must be granted. We are of the view 
that the findings of the first Appellate Court does not suffer from any legal 
infirmity and are accordingly sustained. The other reason which dissuaded the 
Insurance Tribunal to grant the application filed by respondent No.1 under 
Section 122 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000 was that since the assured person 
was not a party to the group insurance contract, his legal heirs had no standing to 
claim liquidated damages. This understanding was inconsistent with the scheme 
of group insurance and the provision of law applicable thereto, and thus, the first 
Appellate Court rightly repelled it with the observation that group insurance is 
designed to provide monetary benefits to the family of the assured person; 
particularly, if the assured person has not defaulted in payment of premium 
amount.

"Director General, Intelligence Bureau v. Riaz-ul-Wahab another & 
Surkharu Khan & another ",2.12,Service Law,Supreme Court of Pakistan,"The petitioner seeks leave to appeal against four judgments of the Federal Service 
Tribunal, whereby the Tribunal, while allowing the appeals of the respondents, 
has expunged the adverse remarks recorded by the Countersigning Officer in their 
Performance Evaluation Reports (“PERs”) of certain periods and restored the 
assessment of their performance made by the Reporting Officers.
","What are the requirements for a Countersigning officer, if he/she intends to record 
adverse remarks in the “PER” of an officer by disagreeing with the assessment of 
his Reporting officer?","The evaluation of the performance of a subordinate officer by his Reporting or 
Countersigning Officer, primarily being a matter of personal assessment based on 
the direct observation of the work of the officer concerned, is not to be usually 
interfered with by the Tribunal or this Court unless malafide with full particulars, 
or the gross violation of the instructions, on the part of the Reporting or 
Countersigning Officer, as the case may be, is shown. In the present case, the 
Tribunal has interfered with and expunged the remarks recorded by the 
Countersigning Officer mainly on the ground of gross violation of the instructions 
on the subject of recording adverse remarks in PERs. According to relevant 
instructions, as a general rule, an officer is to be apprised, if his Reporting or 
Countersigning Officer is dissatisfied with his work, and the communication of 
such dissatisfaction with advice or warning should be prompt so that the officer 
may eradicate the fault and improve his performance. That is why it is emphasised 
that the Reporting or Countersigning Officers should not ordinarily record adverse 
remarks as to the performance of an officer without prior counselling. They are 
thus expected to apprise the officer concerned about his weak points and advise 
him how to improve, and to record the adverse remarks in the PER when the 
officer fails to improve despite counselling. The supervisory officers under whose 
supervision other officers work must realise that the supervision does not mean 
cracking the whip on finding a fault in their performance, rather the primary 
purpose of the supervision is to guide the subordinate officers in improving their 
performance and efficiency, and that their role is more like a mentor rather than a 
punishing authority. As the purpose of counselling is to improve the performance 
of the officer and not to insult or intimidate him, the supervisory officers are also 
to see, having regard to the temperament of the officer concerned, whether the 
advice or warning given orally or in written form, or given publicly in a general 
meeting of the officers or privately in a separate meeting with the concerned 
FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN
officer only, would be beneficial for the officer in improving his performance. 
The directions contained in the instructions, in this regard, on paying great 
attention to the manner and method of communicating advice or warning should 
be adhered to. It must also be pointed out that such guidance, through counselling, 
for improving the performance and efficiency of a subordinate officer, can 
ultimately benefit the organization as it enables identifying and addressing 
performance issues before they become major problems, thereby, leading to 
increased productivity and better performance so that the organization’s goals and 
objectives are effectively achieved","First, the Countersigning officer must give reasons for his disagreement with the 
evaluation of the Reporting officer and secondly, he must do counselling of the 
officer by pointing out his shortcomings and advising him how to improve them. 
If the officer fails to improve despite counselling, then he may record adverse 
remarks in his PER","Mr. Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Mr. Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail,

v) Whether the term ‘discrepancy’ has to be distinguished from ‘contradiction’?","i) Promptness of FIR shows truthfulness of the prosecution case and it excludes possibility of deliberation and consultation. ii) The term ""related"" is not equivalent to ""interested"". A witness may be called ""interested"" only when he or she derives some benefit in seeing an accused person punished. A witness who is a natural one and is the only possible eyewitness in the circumstances of a case cannot be said to be ""interested""."" In the present case, FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN  the eye witnesses, one of whom was an injured eye-witness have spoken consistently and cogently in describing the manner of commission of the crime in detail. The testimony of an injured eyewitness carries more evidentiary value. The Court is not persuaded that their evidence is to be discarded merely because they happen to be related witnesses. iii) The medical evidence available on the record further corroborates the ocular account so far as the nature, time, locale and impact of the injuries on the person of the deceased and injured is concerned. Even otherwise, it is settled law that where ocular evidence is found trustworthy and confidence inspiring, the same is given preference over medical evidence and the same alone is sufficient to sustain conviction of an accused. iv) It is settled principle of law that the value and status of medical evidence and recovery is always corroborative in its nature, which alone is not sufficient to sustain the conviction. Minor discrepancies and conflicts appearing in medical evidence and the ocular version are quite possible for variety of reasons. During occurrence witnesses in a momentary glance make only tentative assessment of the distance between the deceased and the assailant and the points where accused caused injuries. It becomes highly improbable to correctly mention the number and location of the injuries with exactitude. Minor discrepancies, if any, in medical evidence relating to nature of injuries do not negate the direct evidence. v) We may point out that ‘discrepancy’ has to be distinguished from ‘contradiction’. Contradiction in the statement of the witness is fatal for the prosecution case whereas minor discrepancy or variance in evidence will not make the prosecution case doubtful. It is normal course of the human conduct that while narrating a particular incident there may occur minor discrepancies. Parrot like statements are always discredited by the courts. In order to ascertain as to whether the discrepancy pointed out was minor or not or the same amounts to contradiction, regard is required to be made to the circumstances of the case by keeping in view the social status of the witnesses and environment in which such witnesses were making the statement. There are always normal discrepancies, howsoever, honest and truthful a witness may be. Such discrepancies are due to normal errors of observation, memory due to lapse of time and mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence. Material discrepancies are those which are not normal and not expected of a normal person.","i) Promptness of FIR shows truthfulness of the prosecution case and it excludes 
possibility of deliberation and consultation.

The arbitrators awarded amount along with interest. The civil court decreed the 
said amount without interest and executed the decree. Petitioner filed an FAO 
against the order of the civil court, which was dismissed by the Islamabad High 
Court against which the instant petition has been filed by the petitioner","i) What are the grounds for challenging the arbitration award?
ii) What is scope of judicial review of award announced by arbitrators?
iii) What does misconduct of arbitrators means?","i) The grounds for challenging an Award are very limited. There are three broad 
areas on which an arbitration Award is likely to be challenged i.e. firstly, 
jurisdictional grounds (non-existence of a valid and binding arbitration 
agreement); secondly, procedural grounds (failure to observe principles of natural 
justice) and thirdly, substantive grounds (arbitrator made a mistake of law).
ii) There is a limited scope of judicial review of the ‘Award’ announced by an 
Arbitrator. An arbitration Award is a final determination of the dispute between 
the parties. The review of an arbitration Award cannot constitute a re-assessment 
or reappraisal of the evidence by the court. An over-intrusive approach by courts 
in examination of the arbitral Awards must be avoided. The court is not supposed 
to sit as a court of appeal and must confine itself to the patent illegalities in the 
Award, if any. The jurisdiction of the Court under the Act is supervisory in 
nature. Interference is only possible if there exists any breach of duty or any 
irregularity of action which is not consistent with general principles of equity and 
good conscience. The arbitrator alone is the judge of the quality as well as the 
quantity of the evidence. He is the final arbiter of dispute between the parties. He 
acts in a quasi-judicial manner and his decision is entitled to utmost respect and 
weight. By applying the afore-noted principles of law on the subject and 
considering the petitioner’s objections within the limited scope of court’s 
jurisdiction in testing the validity of Award this court is not supposed to sit as a 
court of appeal and make a roving inquiry and look for latent errors of law and 
facts in the Award. The arbitration is a forum of the parties' own choice its 
decision should not be lightly interfered by the court, until a clear and definite 
case within the purview of the section 30 of the Act is made out.
iii) A misconduct of an Arbitrator in the judicial sense means failure to perform 
his essential duty or any conduct inconsistent with his duties, resulting in 
substantial miscarriage of justice between the parties","i) There are three broad areas on which an arbitration Award is likely to be

v) Whether the requirement of corroborative evidence is rule of law?
vi) What is the requirement to be considered by the court while appreciating the 
evidence of a witness?","i) This Court in a number of judgments has held that testimony of police officials is as good as any other private witness unless it is proved that they have animus against the accused. This Court has time and again held that reluctance of general public to become witness in such like cases has become judicially recognized fact and there is no way out to consider statement of official witnesses, as no legal bar or restriction has been imposed in such regard. Police officials are as good witnesses and could be relied upon, if their testimonies remain un-shattered during cross-examination. ii) Process of identification parade has to be essentially carried out having regard to the exigencies of each case in a fair and non-collusive manner and such exercise is not an immutable ritual, inconsequential non-performance whereof, FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN  may cause failure of prosecution case, which otherwise is structured upon clean and probable evidence. Reliance is placed on Tasar Mehmood Vs. The State (2020 SCMR 1013). iii) It is settled law that where ocular evidence is found trustworthy and confidence inspiring, the same is given preference over medical evidence and the same alone is sufficient to sustain conviction of an accused. Reliance is placed on Muhammad Iqbal Vs. The State (1996 SCMR 908), Naeem Akhtar Vs. The State (PLD 2003 SC 396), Faisal Mehmood Vs. The State (2010 SCMR 1025) and Muhammad Ilyas Vs. The State (2011 SCMR 460). iv) It is settled principle of law that the value and status of medical evidence and recovery is always corroborative in its nature, which alone is not sufficient to sustain the conviction. Casual discrepancies and conflicts appearing in medical evidence and the ocular version are quite possible for variety of reasons. Minor discrepancies, if any, in medical evidence relating to nature of injuries do not negate the direct evidence as witnesses are not supposed to give photo picture of ocular account. Even otherwise, conflict of ocular account with medical evidence being not material imprinting any dent in prosecution version would have no adverse effect on prosecution case. v) Requirement of corroborative evidence is not of much significance and same is not a rule of law but is that of prudence. vi) It is a well settled proposition of law that as long as the material aspects of the evidence have a ring of truth, courts should ignore minor discrepancies in the evidence. The test is whether the evidence of a witness inspires confidence. If an omission or discrepancy goes to the root of the matter, the defence can take advantage of the same. While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the evidence read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not affecting the material considerations of the prosecution case ought not to prompt the courts to reject evidence in its entirety. Such minor discrepancies which do not shake the salient features of the prosecution case should be ignored","i) Police officials are as good witnesses as private witnesess and could be relied 
upon, if their testimonies remain un-shattered during cross-examination.

the Appellate Court and as a consequence thereof, the judgment of the Civil Court 
was set aside. Being aggrieved, the petitioner filed a Civil Revision in the High

viii) Whether “consensus ad idem” is one of the conditions to constitute a valid

ix) Whether Court can make out a contract for the parties when an effective and

x) In case of inconsistency between the Trial Court and the Appellate Court, the 
findings of which court can be given preference in the absence of any cogent 
reason to the contrary?","i) According to Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act 1882, “sale” means the 
transfer of ownership in exchange for a price paid or promised or part paid and 
part promised which is made in the case of tangible immovable property of the 
value of one hundred rupees and upwards or in the case of a reversion or other 
intangible thing, can be made only by a registered instrument with further rider 
that a contract for the sale of immovable property is a contract that a sale of such 
property shall take place on terms settled between the parties but it does not, of 
FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN
15
itself, create any interest in or charge on such property.
ii) Whereas under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act 1877, a person entitled to 
any legal character or to right as to any property, may institute a suit against any 
person denying, or interested to deny, his title to such character or right and the 
Court may in its discretion make therein a declaration that he is so entitled, and 
the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any further relief, but according to the 
attached proviso, no Court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, 
being able to seek further relief than mere declaration of title, omits to do so. The 
expression “legal character” has been understood to be synonymous with the 
expression status. A suit for mere declaration is not permissible except in the 
circumstances mentioned in Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. The claim of 
mere declaration as to alleged title does not suffice.
iii) On the basis of a sale agreement, no legal character or right can be established 
to prove the title of the property unless the title is transferred pursuant to such 
agreement to sell, but in case of denial or refusal by the vendor to specifically 
perform the agreement despite the readiness and willingness of the vendee, a suit 
for specific performance may be instituted in the court, but suit for declaration on 
the basis of a mere sale agreement is not the solution for appropriate relief.
iv) Under Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act, the exercise of jurisdiction by the 
Court for decreeing the suit for specific performance of contract is discretionary 
in nature in which the Court is not bound to grant such relief, but in tandem the 
discretion is not to be exercised arbitrarily but should be based on sound legal 
principles after analyzing and gauging the circumstances, inter alia, whether the
contract is such which gives an unfair advantage to the plaintiff over the 
defendant or the performance of the contract encompasses some hardship on the 
defendant which he could not foresee or whether its non-performance would 
embroil some hardship to the plaintiff and whether the plaintiff has done 
substantial acts or suffered losses in consequence of a contract capable of specific 
performance. The person seeking specific performance has to establish that he is 
enthusiastic and vehement to act upon his obligations as per the contract but the 
opponent is refusing or delaying its execution.
v) Obviously, the first part of Article 113 of the Limitation Act refers to the 
exactitudes of its application when time is of the essence of the contract, which 
means an exact timeline was fixed for the performance of obligations arising out 
of the contract/agreement hence, in this particular situation, the limitation period 
or starting point of limitation will be reckoned from that date and not from date of 
refusal, however, if no specific date was fixed for performance of agreement and 
time was not of the essence, then the right to sue will accrue from the date of
knowledge about refusal by the executant.
vi) It was further held that the proposition that where an agreement to sell 
pertaining to immovable property is not signed by one of the parties thereto is, in 
each and every eventuality, invalid and not specifically enforceable is fallacious 
and contrary to the law. The existence and validity of the agreement and it being 
specifically enforceable or otherwise would depend upon the proof of its 
FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN
16
existence, validity and enforceability in accordance with the Qanun-e-Shahadat 
Order, 1984, the relevant provisions of the Contract Act, 1872, the Specific Relief 
Act, 1877, and any other law applicable thereto.
vii) In the aforesaid perspective, the doctrine of prospective overruling is also 
quite relevant which originated in the American Judicial System. The literal 
meaning of the term 'overruling' is to overturn or set aside a precedent by 
expressly deciding that it should no longer be a controlling law. Similarly 
'prospective' means operative or effective in the future. According to the dictum 
laid down in the case of Pakistan Medical and Dental Council & others vs. 
Muhammad Fahad Malik & others (2018 SCMR 1956) the judgments of this 
Court (Supreme Court) unless declared otherwise operate prospectively. More or 
less, similar findings that the law laid down by this Court is prospective which 
cannot be doubted have been recorded in the case of Sakhi Muhammad and 
another vs. Capital Development Authority, Islamabad (PLD 1991 S.C 777) and 
Pir Bakhsh and others vs. The Chairman, Allotment Committee and others, (PLD 
1987 S.C. 145).
viii) No doubt to constitute a valid contract one of the conditions is “consensus ad 
idem” which must exist with regard to the terms and conditions of the contract 
and, in case of any ambiguity, it may adversely reflect on its very existence. In 
fact it is a Latin term in the law of contract that means the existence of meeting of 
minds of all parties involved which is the elementary constituent for the 
enforcement and execution of a contract and in case of no consensus ad idem 
there shall be no binding contract and in case of any palpable inexactitude or 
obliviousness in the settled terms and conditions then there shall be no probability 
to get a hold of any outcome of such defective agreement.
ix) Where an effective and enforceable contract is not structured by the parties, it 
is not the domain or province of the Court to make out a contract for them but the 
lis would be decided on the basis of terms and conditions agreed and settled down 
in the contract. The decree for specific performance may not be passed if the 
substratum of the contract suffers from shortcoming or legal infirmities which 
render the contract unacceptable and unenforceable.
x) In the case of Amjad Ikram vs. Mst. Asiya Kausar (2015 SCMR 1), the court 
held that in case of inconsistency between the Trial Court and the Appellate 
Court, the findings of the latter must be given preference in the absence of any 
cogent reason to the contrary as has been held by this court in the judgments 
reported, as Madan Gopal and 4 others v. Maran Bepari and 3 others (PLD 1969 
SC 617) & Muhammad Nawaz through LRs. v. Haji Muhammad Baran Khan 
through LRs. and others (2013 SCMR 1300).",": i) A contract for sale of immovable property can take place on terms settled 
between the parties but it does not itself, create any interest in or charge on such 
property.
ii) Court cannot make any declaration where the party, being able to seek further 
relief than mere declaration of title, omits to do so

iii) On the basis of a sale agreement, no legal character or right can be established.
iv) The Court for decreeing the suit for specific performance of contract is not

vi) An agreement to sell pertaining to immovable property which is not signed by 
one of the parties is enforceable in law unless proved otherwise.

appellate court non-suiting the petitioners on the issue of limitation. ","(i) Whether limitation does not apply where a person seeks to enforce his right of 
inheritance in the estate of his deceased predecessor?
(ii) When does the right of a person to sue for declaration of right of inheritance in 
the estate of his deceased predecessor accrues?
(iii) Whether the criterion for determination of actual denial of right as to joint 
property is different in cases of co-sharers as compared to strangers? 
(iv) Whether mere omission by brothers to pay a share of the profits or produce of 
the joint property to their sisters amounts to actual denial of rights of the sisters?
(v) Whether a fraudulent sale, gift or mutation of shares of sisters in joint property 
by brothers amounts to actual denial of rights of sisters hence giving rise to 
compulsory cause of action? 
(vi) When would limitation starts to run in case sisters are deprived of their shares 
in joint property through fraud by brothers?
(vii) Whether the benefit of section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1908 is available 
against any person who is a transferee in good faith and for valuable 
consideration?","(i) In view of the provisions of the residuary Article 120 of Schedule-I to the 
Limitation Act 1908, there can hardly be any suit to which the bar of limitation 
does not apply. As per the said Article a suit for which no period of limitation is 
provided elsewhere in the Schedule, the period of limitation for that suit is six 
years from the time when the right to sue accrues. No specific Article of 
Schedule-I to the Limitation Act provides a period of limitation for a suit 
instituted by a person, under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act 1877, for 
declaration of his ownership rights to any property against a person denying his 
said rights; therefore, the residuary Article 120 applies to such suit. A suit 
instituted by a female legal heir for declaration of her ownership rights as to the 
property left by her deceased father in his inheritance, against her brother who 
denies her rights is thus governed by the provisions of Article 120. To decide 
whether such a suit is barred by limitation, the six-year period of limitation 
provided by Article 120 is to be counted from the time when the right to sue for 
declaration accrues as provided therein. 
(ii) The question, when the right to sue for declaration has accrued in a case, 
depends upon the facts and circumstances of that case, as it accrues when the 
FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN
2
defendant denies (actually) or is interested to deny (threatens) the rights of the 
plaintiff as per Section 42 of the Specific relief Act 1877. The actual denial of 
rights gives rise to a compulsory cause of action and obligates the plaintiff to 
institute the suit for declaration of his rights, if he wants to do so, within the 
prescribed period of limitation; while in case of a threatened denial of rights, it is 
the option of the plaintiff to institute such a suit on a particular threat. On the 
actual denial of rights, the cause of action and the consequent right to sue matures 
for instituting the suit for declaration; whereas every threatened denial of rights 
gives rise to a fresh cause of action, and thus a fresh right to sue accrues on such a 
denial.
(iii) Because of the special characteristics of their relationship, the criterion for 
determining the actual denial of a co-sharer’s rights as to joint property by the 
other co-sharer is different from the one that is applied between strangers. Co sharers have a relationship of trust and support for each other. Possession of joint 
property with one co-sharer is considered to be for and on behalf of all the co sharers. A co-sharer who is not in actual possession is considered to be in 
constructive possession of the joint property. Each co-sharer protects the joint 
property against trespassers for the benefit of all the co-sharers. Even if one co sharer acquires possession of some portion of the joint property in consequence of 
legal proceedings initiated by him against a trespasser, he is deemed to be in 
possession of that portion of the joint property, on behalf of all the co-sharers. 
Against this backdrop, the actual denial of a co-sharer’s rights as to joint property 
by the other co-sharer is not to be readily inferred. Actual denial of a co-sharer’s 
rights by the other co-sharer may occur when the latter does something explicit 
in denial of the former’s rights. A mere oral negation, even made several times, of 
each other’s rights by the co-sharers on different disputes as to the use and sharing 
of the profits of the joint property, but without doing any overt act to oust a co sharer from the ownership of the joint property, cannot be treated as an actual 
denial of the rights and thus does not necessitate to sue for declaration of 
ownership rights. 
(iv) Mere omission to pay a share of the profits or produce of the joint property to 
their sisters by the brothers in possession of the joint property does not in itself 
constitute a repudiation of the sisters’ rights, nor does a wrong entry as to the 
inheritance rights in the revenue record oust the sisters from their ownership of 
the joint property as the devolution of the ownership of the property on legal 
heirs of a person takes place under the Islamic law of inheritance immediately on 
the death of that person without any intervention of anyone and without the 
sanction of the inheritance mutation in the revenue record.
(v) The position is, however, different when the brothers in possession of the 
joint property make a fraudulent sale or gift deed or get sanctioned some 
mutation, whether of sale or gift etc., in the revenue record claiming that their 
sisters have transferred their share in the joint property to them, or when they on 
the basis of a wrong inheritance mutation start selling out or otherwise disposing 
of the joint property claiming them to be the exclusive owners thereof. In such 
FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN
3
circumstances, the brothers by their overt act expressly repudiate the rights of 
their sisters in the joint property, and oust them from the ownership of the joint 
property. Their acts are, therefore, a clear and actual denial of the rights of the 
sisters, which give rise to a compulsory cause of action and obligates the sisters to 
institute the suit for declaration of their rights, if they want to do so, within the 
prescribed period of limitation. 
(vi) Although, by the said acts of the brothers, the right accrues to the sisters to 
sue for declaration of their rights, but if they by means of fraud are kept from the 
knowledge of those overt acts, the time limit of six years provided in Article 
120 for instituting the suit for declaration against brothers or any person claiming 
through them otherwise than in good faith and for a valuable consideration, is to 
be computed from the time when the fraud of the brothers first became known to 
the sisters, by virtue of the provisions of Section 18 of the Limitation Act. 
The “fraud” contemplated by Section 18 means suppression of those acts or 
transactions that give rise to the cause of action from coming into the knowledge 
of the plaintiff. A deliberate concealment of facts intended to prevent discovery of 
the right to sue is also a “fraud” within the meaning of the term used in this 
Section, but an open act of a party cannot be said to be a fraudulent act of 
concealment and is therefore not covered by this Section.
(vii) The benefit of Section 18 is, however, not available against any person who 
though claims through the defrauding party but is a transferee in good faith and 
for a valuable consideration. That is why this Court has treated differently the two 
types of cases: (i) where the joint property is still in possession of the defrauding 
brothers or their legal heirs; and (ii) where the joint property has been alienated 
further to third persons- the transferees in good faith and for a valuable 
consideration","(i) Limitation does apply where a person seeks to enforce his right of inheritance 
in the estate of his deceased predecessor.
(ii) The right of a person to sue for declaration of right of inheritance in the estate 
of his deceased predecessor accrues when the defendant denies (actually) or is 
interested to deny (threatens) such rights of the plaintiff.
(iii) The criterion for determination of actual denial of right as to joint property is 
different in cases of co-sharers as compared to strangers. 
(iv) Mere omission by brothers to pay a share of the profits or produce of the joint 
property to their sisters does not amount to actual denial of rights of the sisters.
(v) A fraudulent sale, gift or mutation of shares of sisters in joint property by 
brothers amounts to actual denial of rights of sisters hence giving rise to 
compulsory cause of action.
(vi) In case sisters are deprived of their shares in joint property through fraud by 
brothers then limitation will be computed from the time when the fraud of the 
brothers first became known to the sisters.
(vii) The benefit of section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1908 is not available against 
any person who is a transferee in good faith and for valuable consideration.

1973, which prescribes that a civil servant possessing such minimum 
qualifications as may be prescribed shall be eligible for promotion to a higher 
post. In Sub-Section (3), it is clearly provided that promotions to the posts in 
BPS-20 and BPS-21 and equivalent shall be made on the recommendations of the 
Selection Board, which shall be headed by the Chairman, Federal Public Service 
Commission. According to Sub-Clause (b) of Rule 2 of the Civil Servants 
(Appointment, Promotion & Transfer) Rules, 1973, (APT Rules, 1973) Central 
Selection Board (CSB) means a Board constituted by the Federal Government for 
the purposes of selection for promotion or transfer to a post in BPS-18 in the
District Management Group, Police Group and posts in BPS-19 to 21 and

person as possesses the qualification and meet the conditions laid down for the 
purpose of promotion or transfer to a post, shall be considered by the DPC or the

iii) Whether institutions which are funded by the public can be referred to as state

iv) Whether the Constitution or the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 grant to the Chief 
Justice (or to the Registrar) the power to make special benches?
(v)Whether the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 provide how to attend Suo Motu 
cases?
(vi) Whether collective determination by the Chief Justice and the Judges of the 
Supreme Court can be assumed by only the Chief Justice?","i) The Judiciary would be flawed if it is not open to constructive criticism. The 
Judiciary exists to serve the people and should embrace observations, opinions, 
and critique as it also serves as a check on its own functioning. The people's 
feedback also helps identify shortcomings, which can thereafter be addressed. 
Constructive criticism serves the interest of the Judiciary as it helps improve its 
performance. The relationship between the litigant, who is the service-user, and 
the Judiciary, which is the service-provider, should be collaborative, with the 
common goal of improving the service. Forbidding criticism neither serves the 
interest of the people nor of the Judiciary. Islam does not prohibit the criticism of 
Judges. Believers must speak the truth. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings 
FORTNIGHTLY CASE LAW BULLETIN
7
be upon him) taught that the highest form of jihad (struggle) is to speak up against 
an oppressor, and if despite seeing wrongdoing people do nothing, then they too 
will be punished. Judges adjudicate, and at times hold others to account. 
Therefore, it would be constitutionally, legally, morally, and religiously 
indefensible to absolve Judges from accountability. Prescribing something for 
others but not abiding by it oneself is most offensive to Almighty Allah and He 
castigates hypocrites. PEMRA's complete prohibition to criticize Judges offends 
the Constitution, law, morality, and Islam.
ii) The Chairman of PEMRA, alone, does not constitute PEMRA. The law which 
established and governs PEMRA states that, 'All orders, determinations and 
decisions of the Authority [PEMRA] shall be taken in writing and shall identify 
the determination of the Chairman and each member separatel y.' PEMRA 
comprises of the 'Chairman and twelve members'. However, the Prohibition Order 
does not disclose if the members had any say in the matter, let alone whether a 
meeting of the members took place, how many attended it and their 
determinations. This lack of disclosure by a statutory-regulatory body is of 
concern.
iii) State institutions are neither mentioned in the Constitution nor in PEMRA's 
law. Institutions which are funded by the public may be referred to as public 
institutions, acknowledging the public's ownership, and that they serve the public. 
When the phrase public institution is substituted with state institution, it is not 
inconsequential phraseology; as the public's ownership of the institution is 
severed and renders it unaccountable.
iv) Neither the Constitution nor the Rules grant to the Chief Justice (or to the 
Registrar) the power to make special benches, select Judges who will be on these 
benches and decide the cases which they will hear. There is also no additional, 
incidental, ancillary, or residual power with the Chief Justice which could be 
used to do this. Yet, unfortunately, this is being done, and sometimes with grave 
repercussions. When benches are tailored and Judges of a particular 
understanding or inclination are placed together to hear a particular case, then 
doubts, suspicion, and misgivings arise. A decision from an adjudicatory process, 
which is perceived to be structured to obtain a particular decision, invariably 
results in severe criticism. The matter assumes criticality when objections taken 
on the constitution of Special Benches, and requests made for hearing by the Full 
Court, are not attended to, and no order disposing of such objections and requests 
is passed.
v) With regard to article 184(3) of the Constitution there are three categories of 
cases. Firstly, when a formal application seeking enforcement of Fundamental 
Rights is filed. Secondly, when (suo mot-u) notice is taken by the Supreme Court 
or its Judges. And, thirdly cases of immense constitutional importance and 
significance (which may also be those in the first and second category). Order 
XXV of the Rules only attends to the first category of cases. There is no 
procedure prescribed for the second and third category of cases. The situation is 
exacerbated as there is no appeal against a decision under Article 184(3) of the 
Constitution. The Rules also do not provide how to attend to the following 
matters: (a) how such cases be listed for hearing, (b) how bench/benches to hear 
such cases be constituted and (c) how Judges hearing them are selected.
vi) The Supreme Court is empowered to make makes rules attending to the 
aforesaid matters. The Supreme Court comprises of the Chief Justice and all 
Judges."" The Constitution does not grant to the Chief Justice unilateral and 
arbitrary power to decide the above matters. With respect, the Chief Justice 
cannot substitute his personal wisdom with that of the Constitution, Collective 
determination by the Chief Justice and the Judges of the Supreme Court can also 
not be assumed by an individual, albeit the Chief Justice","i) PEMRA's complete prohibition to criticize judges offends the constitution, law, 
morality, and Islam.
ii) The Chairman of PEMRA, alone, does not constitute PEMRA.
iii) Institutions which are funded by the public cannot be referred to as state 
institutions. 
iv) The Constitution or the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 do not grant to the Chief 
Justice (or to the Registrar) the power to make special benches.
