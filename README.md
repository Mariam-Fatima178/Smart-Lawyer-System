# Smart-Lawyer-System
<p>Tools/Tech Used: 
Python, Python Libraries, NLP (Natural Language Processing), SQL, XAMPP, Flask.</p> 
<p>Description: 
The Smart Lawyer System is the result of combining knowledge from various sources, including tutorials, documentation, and practical experimentation. The development process involved applying data analytics and natural language processing (NLP) to build an application that helps search legal cases efficiently.</p>

### ðŸ’¡ Key Learning Outcomes:
- **Flask Web Development**: Developed the backend of the web application.
- **Data Handling**: Used **pandas** to manage and query case data.
- **NLP**: Implemented algorithms to improve the search relevance of legal cases.
- **Frontend Design**: Designed the user interface using **HTML** and **CSS**.

## Why I Included This Project

This project gave me the chance to **explore new areas** like **NLP**, **web development**, and **data handling**. As a beginner, Iâ€™ve been learning about different tools and technologies, and this project helped me apply some of that knowledge while working on a **real-world application**.

While Iâ€™m still in the process of developing my skills, working on this project allowed me to get hands-on experience with **combining different technologies** and understanding how **data-driven applications** can be built. Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and improving as I work on more projects in the future.
